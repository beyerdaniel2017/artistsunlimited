AB THE THIEF,Indie/Alternative,AB,http://soundcloud.com/abthethief,Primalfilth@gmail.com,"-- AB THE THIEF --
BOOKING: Primalfilth@gmail.com
PROMO: abthethiefpromo@gmail.com

AB THE THIEF is a Bay Area based artist who represents a new age brand of 808-heavy dance music fusing bass vibes, West Coast Hip Hop influences, and a next level approach to modern production that has continued to make its mark on the world of mainstage music. 

He first caught traction in the trap scene with his 2014 bootleg remix for Kandy & Kyle Hughes ABNORMAAL. Following his debut 2015 coast-to-coast American #ABductionTour and debut merchandise launch, AB has amassed a cult like following from bass heads worldwide.

AB's work has challenged the gridlocked space of bass music with his own original productions, such as “Get Smoked” and “Fracture” as well as his remix projects for Hasse De Moore's ""Time Out"" and a bootleg for Future's ""Thought It Was A Drought"" that picked up over a quarter of a million plays. His message has been taken more seriously after picking up heavyweight support from the likes of GTA, DJ Snake, Excision, TJR and Adventure Club for his new approach. The ABduction continues.

De Sluwe Vos,Indie/Alternative,"Patron, 4 Lux, Slapfunk, Albion.",http://soundcloud.com/desluwevos,niels@meanwhile.nl,"De Sluwe Vos's Upcoming Gigs: http://desluwevos.com

De Sluwe Vos (Dutch for 'The Sly Fox', a name derived from Aesop's fable of the Fox and the Crow) is the newest addition to the Dutch house and techno scene. His productions are supported by artists such as DJ Sneak, Joy Orbison, Boddika and Bicep. Moreover, De Sluwe Vos has a packed tour schedule and travels many miles for all his national and international gigs.
With strong hooks and dirty kicks as his specialities, De Sluwe Vos has released multiple tracks on labels like 4Lux and Slapfunk. Lately, this cheerful producer from Dutch city of Deventer has even been gaining a foothold in the pop scene. His gig at Noorderslag did not go unnoticed: national music platform 3voor12 named him the best act of the festival. 

De Sluwe Vos mixes various styles to create his own 'signature sound' with which he manages to constantly keep himself at the center of attention. His 'OG Anthem' is possibly one of the most notable tracks of the moment; this underground hit found its way to the surface and received airplay on both Dutch radio station 3FM and BBC Radio1. 

With his discography, De Sluwe Vos is constructing a steady career. But he's not one to stay hidden away in the studio: he's at his best when dominating dance floors in clubs and at festivals. His ultimate goal is to bring the crowd to a higher state of mind, where worries simply disappear and the music takes over. Time and time again, De Sluwe Vos provides proof for the big bang theory with his performances. Whether it's at Awakenings Festival in the Netherlands or at Together Festival in Cardiff: during his shows he is pure energy. His duet between his Roland TR- 909 drum computer and turntables is always a bold endeavor, just like his stage diving. 

The fact that he is a fixture of the club scene is proven by his monthly international gigs, his own night The Core and his notorious live act. With the audiovisual show 'Kontra live', De Sluwe Vos is well underway to becoming 'one of the greats'. And that's no fable!

<p>Strange! &#13;
 &#13;
Schon mit seinem außergewöhnlichen Erscheinungsbild zaubert Der HouseKaspeR aus Leipzig Jedem ein Lächeln ins Gesicht.  Seine verrückte Art und sein experimenteller Stil, was Kleidung und diverse andere Gimmicks angeht sind einzigartig, genau wie sein musikalischer Stil. &#13;
Wiederzufinden ist er im House-Genre. Mal härter, mal softer, überschreitet er aber auch dort jegliche kreative Grenzen und probiert sich zusammen mit dem Publikum in seinen Sets eine coole, verrückte und einzigartige Reise zu zelebrieren. &#13;
Wer erwartet einen alltäglichen House-Act hinter der Booth zu haben, irrt sich gewaltig! Denn mit seiner Show gespickt mit vielen verrückten Highlights, wie z.B. seinem Markenzeichen der „KaspeR-Maske“ oder seinen Hello Kitty Schwimmflügeln, Robby Bubble Sekt, Konfettikanonen und und und wird es auf keinen Fall langweilig mit ihm.&#13;
Referenzen konnte Der HouseKaspeR schon mehr als weitläufig sammeln. &#13;
Das WeekEnd in Berlin, die Diamantfabrik in Magdeburg, der Musikpark in Dresden, das Nightlfy in Schwarzenberg, das Club Velvet, das Nachcafe, die Alte Hauptpost, der Volkspalast in Leipzig sind nur ein kleiner Auszug seiner Club-Referenzen. Er bespielte auch schon diverse Großevents, wie das SonneMondSterne Festival, das Sputnik Springbreak Festival, das Stereo City Festival. Sogar international konnte Der HouseKaspeR in der Arena Dinxperlo in den Niederlanden überzeugen. &#13;
Der HouseKaspeR ist also auf dem Weg eine Top Nummer in den nationalen und internationalen Regionen zu werden!&#13;

PROXY,Indie/Alternative,,http://soundcloud.com/useproxy,paul@primarytalent.com,"BOOKING WORLDWIDE: 
Paul McQueen @ Primary Talent
paul@primarytalent.com

From the ashes of the Soviet empire, from the flames of history, rises PROXY. Post 9/11 rave vibes cloaked in Muscovite angst. A line drawn in smoking rubble along the border dividing East and West, Stüssy and Spetsnaz.

1997. The Year of Tar and Horses. The Prodigy plays Red Square in Moscow. Hundreds of thousands of people attend the show, but only one is truly changed. By the crushing sound. By people absolutely losing their shit to synths and sustained aggression.

The experience causes PROXY to question the quality and purpose of Russian “electrica” acts like Nu-Lag Xpressions and Sweatislav. There was simply no scene from which to emerge. “Whatever a fool does, he does it wrong. A poor dancer is impeded even by his own balls,” he recalls.

In a decade’s time, PROXY would be remixing Prodigy and opening for them on a massive tour of Russia.

2004. PROXY grows interested in the increasingly punishing sounds of the electro scene, as he hears Tiga sing “Hey You Little Children of Glasnost” at the W Hotel in Anzhero-Sudzhensk.

2006. PROXY reaches out to Tiga via his MySpace page. Thomas Von Party intercepts the message and is stunned by fully formed landmines like “Destroy”. Masquerading as Tiga, he signs PROXY to Turbo Recordings, beginning his own deceit-fueled ascent up the biz-ladder of the music ladder-business.

2007 to present. PROXY earns respect and awe from such heavyweights as Justice, Soulwax, Boys Noize, Erol Alkan and Mr. Oizo with astonishing, severe tracks like “Decoy”, “Dance in Dark” and the massive “Raven”, which merits special mention not just because of its ubiquity, but because it illustrates in full the singular power of PROXY MUSIC.

Recall, if you will, the first time you were ever caught in an explosion. Close enough to the blast that the only things that register are a light beyond blinding and a sound that arrives too soon. Now imagine that as you lose your body to the fire you are reassembled, better, your self subsumed by something far greater (for many, this experience seems to manifest itself as sitting in obedient unison). The sound now commands you, transmuting you into the screaming, searing blare.

PROXY has also produced remixes for Peaches, Prodigy, Tiga, Boys Noize, Chromeo, Digitalism, Moby and a host of others willing to pay him in Kocmoc cigarettes.

2013 the second part of his debut opus 'Music from the east block Jungles is released. An ongoing tour has led us into mid 2014 with a debut release on Feed Me's 'Sotto Voce' Imprint with '10,000' to critical acclaim. The future is looking archaic.

“My music tells you what to do, but never why. Your ear may be afraid, but your body completes its labour.”

G-WIZARD (AUS),Indie/Alternative,G Wizard,http://soundcloud.com/dj-g-wizard,Pat.Ward@ministryofsound.com,"Booking Agent: Pat Ward - Ministry Of Sound Pat.Ward@ministryofsound.com.au

Managment: Matt Downey - 
Matt@downwiththeincrowd.com

Across the better half of the last decade, G-Wizard has traversed the countryside, flipping beats, bootlegs and bass into a show of pure electronic energy. 

Armed with 4 CDJ’s and a lone USB stick, G-Wizard has parlayed his signature showmanship into residencies at the Australia's premiere dance spaces, earning universal acclaim for his explosive energy and live remixes.

From stage to studio, G-Wizard has been crafting his own bass laden sound, drawing inspiration from the experiences that a decade of playing parties has provided him. The result is a sonic hybrid that captures the dynamic of his now-trademark live shows, and layers it with strong song writing sensibilities, that is as much as home in the clubs as it on the radio.

Across the clubs, charts and radio, evidence of The Wizard’s production prowess is absolutely unmissable. When he’s not riding the airwaves with tracks like “Great Relief”, “Crossing Over” and the #1 single “Serotonin”, he’s hitting the main the stage with official remixes for Pitbull & Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Bombs Away, Kronic & Tom Piper. Of course, that’s between clocking up studio hours co-writing and producing for Australia’s up and coming pop talent, including the likes Marvin Priest, Elen Levon, Max & Bianca and more.

In addition to enchanting the ears of thousands across Australia’s clubs week-in-week-out, G-Wizard bring his taste making and technique to the airwaves via 'G-Wizard Radio', broadcast every Friday on The Edge 96.1FM (NSW – Australian Radio Network).

Sibling production and DJ duo Star.One have built a reputation as purveyors of UK underground music. Soundsystem-like in nature, they refuse to stick to one genre, instead mixing and blending between the Garage, Grime and Jungle sounds of their youth. Their 2014 'Elements' mixtape was a perfect display of this featuring the likes of P Money, D Double E, G Frsh, Doctor and Creed MC. The mixtape gained the attention of industry tastemakers and led to the influential BBC Introducing platform taking Star.One under their wing.

2015-16 sees Star.One release a string of new music and big collaborations as they tour their DJ sets worldwide, taking ravers on a musical journey through the history of their influences, combined with the freshest upfront sounds. As their production credits rise, the Star.One movement gathers pace.",5221,223,http://www.facebook.com/StarOneUK,http://www.facebook.com/StarOneUK,http://www.twitter.com/StarOneUk,http://www.youtube.com/user/staroneuk,,5,cian@soul2streets.comfrancesco@primarytalent.comstaronemusicuk@gmail.com

At Just 18, Dylan Haber is sitting on top of a discography of epic originals, remixes and collaborations released on some of Australia’s best known labels - Ministry Of Sound (AUS), Onelove Recordings, Safari Music, Hype Recordings and Phethouse Records to name a few. 

Dylan began his DJ career after buying two turntables, a mixer and producing software all on his brothers credit card and receiving lessons from fellow Lucky Ent artist Zoolanda. 

Since starting his DJing career in June 2011 and his career as a producer in just 2012, Dylan has shown a promising knack for DJing and has demonstrated producing capabilities way beyond that of your average 18 year old. Polling at No. 20 In Australia's Top 50 DJs/ITM Awards, releasing his debut album 'Day One We Bounce' and regular gigs all around the country are just the tip of the iceberg on this young guns achievement list. 

2014 was good to Haber, but 2015 and beyond is undoubtedly set to be one hell of an adventure for Haber, be sure to keep an eye on this superstar in the making.

Hungarian-born Peter Simon has been writing music since his early teens, scoring his first vinyl release in 2008. Highly acclaimed for his WAR series of white label releases, he quickly made the connection between underground bass music and the Jamaican reggae sound. His music has been supported by UK tastemakers such as Toddla T, Mary Anne Hobbs and David Rodigan.

Making the move from Budapest to Bristol, he quickly set foot scoring a guest mix on Skream's Rinse FM show, and multiple spots on high profile compilations such as 'This is Dubstep' or the Ministry Of Sound's 'The Sound of Dubstep'.

Setting up his own imprint 'Roots & Future', he continues building up a diverse following who love the old school dubwise sounds with bone-shaking bass and the low end of the sonic spectrum.

After spending time in Tokyo, now basing himself in North-America, his main focus is to bring this fusion of reggae music with modern sounds to the next level. With his recent EP titled 'Rum Punch' on Om Unit's Cosmic Bridge Records he has set the tone for future productions: heavy 808's across genres.",16640,12,http://facebook.com/djmaddbeats,http://facebook.com/djmaddbeats,http://twitter.com/djmadd,http://youtube.com/user/rootsandfutureTV,"http://djmadd.com

Brynny has fast become an important fixture on the Melbourne Bounce scene. Hailing from the Mornington Peninsula, it was only a matter of time before the wunderkind’s passion for all things music and bounce saw him venturing into the city – and once he arrived his enthusiasm and talent was on display for all to see. Brynny brings a musical understanding to the table which is impressive for his young age, and his melody-driven bounce sets have found favour with a more commercial crowd who’s not afraid to have fun; however, don’t write him off as a one trick pony. Brynny has now begun to pioneer his own inimitable kick bass sound, gathering fans across the spectrum, with his more mid-tempo, glitch hop, dubstep and complextro inspired productions having a well established cult following.
 
Calling the likes of Will Sparks, New World Sound, Mash n Kutcher and J-Trick fans of your work is no mean feat, and a definite statement to his talent which has seen him become a resident at Adelaide's HQ, Candy's in Sydney and Melbourne’s home of bounce music, Cloud Nine. The bookings have come in thick and fast, adding Stereosonic, Goodlife and many international gigs to his portfolio, including Glasgow, Indonesia & South Korea. 
 
Kicking into gear in 2016, Brynny prepares to hone in on his own sound and establish a career on a global scale. Armed with new and exciting productions, he is ready to conquer the world.

THE STORY OF OLIVER TWIZT

Where is this Oliver Twizt from?
Born in the Netherlands in the 80's he's been scouring the local recordshops ever since he can remember – at the time it was mainly hardcore and hiphop that caught his ear and eye, cultivating a serious addiction to gangster rap but all the while he also liked the “Ruffneck rules the Artcore scene” stuff…pretty weird for a black kid..

Yeah ok what happened with that weird kid?
After Oliver discovered Fruity Loops in 2000 at the green age of 17 (nowadays FL Studio) he started getting into music production and fancied himself somewhat of a Timbaland of his time – all the while his first baby steps in the magical world of music creation got him some attention of his bestest of friends only – nonetheless he was PROUD!

But that was around the Millenium what happened since then?
OK – Flash forward to 2006 , finished grammar school 2 years delayed due to diverted interests in creation of Jackin Beats, going to clubs and hitting on girls; fasttracked through Tech Uni becoming Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design decided to bin the school career in favour of the unsure future of making a career out of making those fidgety sounding techno shuffled ghetto beats.

Didn’t he have to do something with Skitzofrenix?
Yes! Under his moniker of J Twizt he did the productional honors for various prolific remixes and tracks for labels such as Sidney Samson’s Samsobeats, Gregor Salto s G Rex Recordings, with the J abbreviated from Joel – his real-life first name.

So *huh* I still don t get the name Oliver Twizt?
Well pretty soon – we are now talking like 2008 – 2009 – the productional mastermind got the itch to DJ himself and venture out on his own – to avoid confusion the new aka was created this time made up of his second real life name combined with the old moniker et voila! Oliver Twizt was born!

OK, ok and how did going solo work out for him?
Pretty good really! Oliver’s first solo track feat MC Roga “Do The Monkey” entered the UK Buzz Charts at number 4 and got wide support by the likes of Roger Sanchez, Sander van Doorn, Carl Cox, Judge Jules and many more. Quite soon Oliver started taking over charts with tracks like “Underground”, “Finally” (with Bart B More, #2 Beatport Chart), “You’re Not Alone” (#1 PH chart Beatport, “Another Step” which was a top 10 best sold Hed Kandi record in 2009 and remixed Bart B More, Sander van Doorn, Erick E and many more!

And how is it all looking for Oliver Twizt now?
Oliver continued with a steady slew of releases, the Dutch titled “Wil Jij Dansen” (ft Divine) on Spinnin Records was madly supported by all Dutch Jocks. Followed by the extremely cool “Gangsterdam” on Laidback Luke’s Mighty Mixmash Records, with full support from Luke himself, David Guetta (quote: “I love the Oliver Twizt, it’s gangster!”) Sidney Samson, Chuckie amongst many others. He released his EP ‘Loca’ (feat maluca) on uber cool and credible (Diplo owned) Mad Decent Records for hissmashing all the while doing ‘Headbanger’ and Bimma (ft. Bassjackers) for Sneakerz Muzik

What s coming next?
Having just wrapped his remix for Pitbull featuring Marc Anthony Rain over Me, his remix for Sandro Silva feat Bizzey – Get Lower is making its ascend on the charts, his next release on Spinnin Love Trip is slated for an early fall release and hi co-production ‘Go’ with Diplo for the album from this Philly musical adventurer is set to hit the scene as well. With such a big push Oliver will continue to ride the musical swell and is slated to keep surprising the world with his eclectic sounds
– Expect the Unexpected!!

Pursuing a lifelong passion, he mainly produces chillout electronic music filled with warm and gentle sounds.

Some of his best works:
''You're Not Alone''
''You're Free''
''Without You''
''Small Losses''

Music artist and producer
of EDM, Pop, and WhateveriFeelLikeMaking.

I grew up in mitten-shaped Michigan, USA. I wasn’t especially interested in music as a kid, but then bam, I started learning guitar and fiddled around with making some pretty awful-sounding electronic music on Garageband, and something ""magical"" happened. And I love the magic of music. And so I make it.

I've been into house, funk & disco since '86. My debut release was on The Chopshop label with an track called ""In the Mix"" closely followed by ""Twisted Message"" that was remixed by DJ Butcher also on Chopshop. I then had shared a spot on the Get Down Edits 5 download E.P. Shortly after two more releases with a vocal version and a dub of a mash up track called ""Glow at Night"" which was back on Chopshop. My 4 track E.P. came out in February 2014 and at the same time I had an edit out on Disco Dat called ""I Hear Music"". Following on with an E.P. for Sound Exhibitions and a follow up to my Chopshop E.P. ""Rip More Funk"". A new EP ""Freshly Squeezed"" had a number one single with Fingerman's Hot Digit's label back in February and a new E.P.'s with Masterworks out in August 2015,

Nails pin the hands and the feet of the infant children to the
telephone poles. The crows feed upon their carrion. Their empty eyes
stare through the swarms of malignant flies as their blood sweats
through the soil. Mothers weep at their children’s bloody feet; the
cries of every mother blend in with each other creating a mass hum
that reverberates around the world. The families that resisted were
soaked in gasoline then burnt alive - all burnt inside their own
homes. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I cast my
eyes upon a mother weeping at the feet of her murdered family. I grab
her by her hair then I drag her into an alley where I sodomize her. As
I fuck her, I smash her face into the bricks. Choking, pounding, I
fuck and strangle her until I cum onto her deconstructed face. Once my
dick pulls out her intestines hit the floor. Her cunt tears then her
bowls began to pour. I watch her bleed out.",27853,65,,,https://twitter.com/Sadhudubstep,,"https://www.gig-well.com/agency/bass-embassy/artist/sadhu

Superbreak’s Dj style reflect their productions, the all action, diversity and the constant surprises at every turn, is where itʼs true strength lies, combining slo-mo boogie, groove laden disco, quality house, 70’s funk rock and party funk/boogie and always adept at reading the crowd thanks to combined decades plus experience behind the decks, they pride themselves on getting the crowd moving, whether they’re into boogie bombs, sleazy deep house, party funk or deep house/disco.
They have played along side luminaries such as Kenny Dope and Little Louie Vega to name a few. So, over the years Superbreak has been busy throwing dance parties, club nights, private and exclusive throwdowns, doing edits, producing original work, running a label and if that isnʼt enough, there will be more releases expected this year and just completed a busy European tour last summer. In addition, Superbreak is currently producing a string Vinyl Releases for 2016 which proves Superbreak is going from strength to strength and is a name to look out for to cater for all your disco, house and boogie needs!

Biographie : Trois garçons dans l’ombre, éblouis par le soleil de leur premier succès sur le titre ""Photomaton"", s'amusent à satelliser des voix qui viennent sublimer leurs beats intransigeants. Comme l’écrit Lewis Carroll « ils ont l’air sages eux les enfants sages, mais méfiez vous des images ». Derrière une douceur affichée, la puissance du Jabberwocky gronde… Une sorte de rumeur nocturne se dégage et donne aux morceaux une teinte singulièrement joyeuse et mélancolique à la fois. 
Comme quelque chose de beau sur le point de finir, auquel on ne peut se résoudre, comme la fin d’une nuit qui ne veut pas se mettre au lit.

EVERY JOURNEY CREATES A NEW SOUND

There isn’t only black when the night is falling, the streets are not empty, the people just wake up together with synthetic lights. Melodys and emotions getting together and everywhere you can meet some great artists feeling the same mood.
Traveling and touring is an inspiration for Samuel Kindermann alias Einmusik. This is why he founded his own label Einmusika where sounds come together, where artists meet and where the music he likes is getting a place for reaching the electronic scence.
Einmusika is not only a platform, it is a playground for new handpicked production talents from all over the world. It sounds good when the night is falling over the club and it feels good when Samuel Kindermann takes new sounds with him.

manager: dannyunited@topshelfmgmt.com

San Francisco-based producer, Antiserum, is a permanent fixture atop the cresting wave that is forward-thinking bass music. Over the years, his inventive and ever-evolving style has landed his records on many of dance music's leading imprints including OWSLA, SMOG, Firepower, and Never Say Die, in turn gaining earnest support from every heavyweight of the genre including Skrillex, Diplo, Bassnectar, RL Grime, 12th Planet, and countless others. From hip hop-inspired highlights like ""Brick Squad Anthem"" and ""Trippy"" produced with longtime collaborator, Mayhem, to the cutting edge sounds of his most recent single ""Boom"" with Tha Trickaz and Snails collab ""Wild"", Antiserum's sub-heavy output has continually pushed boundaries in bass music with voracious creativity.

As with every year, 2015 saw Antiserum bringing his electrifying sets around the globe, hitting nearly 40 cities in the US with Crizzly from January to May before touring in Australia and New Zealand over summer. After a few months locked away in the studio, Antiserum will be hitting the road once again this fall with his pal Mayhem, embarking on his first-ever headline tour where he'll premiere all of the new material he's been making this year.

Performed in more than 10 different countries, they've been invited to play at the world's number one festival Tomorrowland 5 times in a row and they're celebrating chart-topping releases and headlining at venues such as Nikki Beach, Noxx Antwerp, Bloomingdale, La Rocca and more... That's not just a coincidence: 2Dirty is on fire!

Ever since their first hit 5 years ago, the Dutch DJ duo 2Dirty worked their way into the dance scene, quickly gaining support and fans worldwide with their energetic, uplifting and sexy house sound. Tracks like 'Climax In My Head' (Dance Tunes #1 and Dutch Single top 50), Let's Get Dirty and Our House Music are received well and played by DJs such as Tiësto, Diplo, Chuckie and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike. Their busy show schedule takes them from The States, to France, Turkey, Albany and Spain, establishing them as a popular DJ act in The Netherlands and Belgium.

Their 5th anniversary was celebrated with their first (and sold out!) 2Dirty event in Maastricht Music Hall, setting an example for what the future may bring for these two passionate friends: more gigs, more events, more followers and above all: more music!",5132,81,http://www.facebook.com/2DirtyMusic,http://www.facebook.com/2DirtyMusic,http://www.twitter.com/2dirty,http://www.youtube.com/2DirtyTube,"http://www.2dirty.com

BOOKINGS 
✉ booking@steedlord.com

Born from Icelandic roots and now in the Los Angeles hub of all things music and art, Steed Lord is a trio that has mastered yesterday’s sound in harmony to the electrifying feel of tomorrow’s dance floors. Lead vocalist Kali embodies an infectious strength through both her powerful soulful voice and keen fashion sense; a presence only boosted by brothers Mega and Eddie House and their adept production abilities. The trio’s unique approach, out-of-this-world style and exhilarating live performances pave only the beginning of a boundless creative path for Steed Lord.

Few artists have prolifically balanced music, fashion, and cinema together as Steed Lord has. Their 2014 single “Curtain Call,” and remix of Flavr Blue’s “We Can Go Blind” are the first taste of Steed Lord’s newly polished sultry, disco and techno-infused synth-pop sound. Ready to take the leap from studio writing sessions and return to headlining shows, Steed Lord is finally prepared to welcome the rejuvenated nu-electronic magic of today’s tomorrow. From the same innovative world of The Prophecy Part 1 soon arrives Steed Lord’s monumental rebirth - a New Prophecy in 2015. 

Steed Lord – a comprehensive audiovisual burst – earned gilded respects for The Prophecy Part 1 as Ireland’s top radio station RTE’s “Best Album of the Year” and penned Berlin fashion magazine Honk’s top choice for “Song of the Year” with Bed of Needles. Also deeply embedded in the realm of fashion, Steed Lord has previously created fashion design collaborations with H&amp;M and WeSC. The multi-talented Steed Lord have also proudly self-produced and directed all of their own music videos as well as videos and art films for Universal Records, The Standard Hotel, WeSC, and have been featured under the Nordic Film spotlight. A group so creatively inspired and relished even by the prestigious of Italian Vogue and Dolce &amp; Gabbana has no other direction to go but forward. 

Steed Lord’s spectacular repertoire is the successful result of a love for music and art steadily built with creative works and inspirations. Unquestionably, 2015 is primed as a peak era for Steed Lord: a time of rebirth, an artistic turning point, and a period of creative exploration that will aim to feed the hedonistic interest of curious eyes and ears.

Pioneering his own Power House genre, Styline has proven his versatility as a producer and has garnered a solid legion of followers with his innovative and dynamic productions.  

Starting out in 2009, Styline dedicated his free time to crafting high-energy filled electro and progressive house mixes, which he uploaded onto his YouTube channel. Winning listeners over with his skillful selections, he amassed over 200 million views on his channel, making a name for himself as a worldwide Internet phenomenon. Founding Arcane, the largest DJ Network on YouTube, Styline established an entirely new path for DJs and producers and the way that people access the world of electronic dance music. Taking his passion to the next level, Styline decided to take his music overseas, focusing on the burgeoning Asian electronic dance music scene, securing himself a residency at one of the most reputable nightclubs in Asia, M1NT Club Shanghai. 

Attracting music lovers to his SoundCloud with a selection of hard-hitting remixes and originals, all available for free download, Styline has spent the past 6 months developing his distinctive Power House genre. Featuring punchy basslines, groove-inducing melodies and tailored vocals, this genre has surged in popularity and has taken club music to a completely new realm. Releasing his dance floor gem ‘Rose’ in December 2015, Styline caught the attention of Spinnin’ Records, who signed the track to their SPRS imprint and released it with a fitting music video on their YouTube channel. With Styline’s massive remixes making their rounds, such as his edit of Valentino Khan’s ‘Deep Down Low’, his signature sound is infiltrating into the charts and readying the electronic music world for the future of Power House! Aside from a prolific release schedule, Styline has delivered copious amounts of energy-fuelled live shows over the past few years, further raising awareness about the remarkable artist that he is.

Garnering over 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel and over 200,000 fans on Facebook, in a short time Styline has made a colossal mark on the music world, and is just getting warmed up. With plenty more releases lined up, and an abundance of ideas ready to get put into action, Styline will not rest until he has spread his coveted sound to every corner of the globe in an emphatic manner. Gearing up to make 2016 his biggest year to date, Styline is set to perform at some of the most important dance music events this year; including Ultra Music Festival Miami, Inception At Sea alongside The Chainsmokers and Winter Music Conference shows. With a burning desire to take his prodigious sound to the next level over the course of the year, stay tuned for the next phase of Styline’s enthralling Power House takeover!",164909,24,http://facebook.com/DJStyline,http://facebook.com/DJStyline,http://twitter.com/DJStyline,http://youtube.com/c/Styline,"http://mixcloud.com/Styline

At the core of Indie Dance and Deep House music, Swiss based DJ, producer and musical maverick Nora En Pure is someone who connects dots between different and disparate sounds, styles and scenes with ease.

The vivid South African, has already proven to be quite productive, what resulted in deep and funky works of audible engineering for the label Enormous Tunes and Tokenish since 2009. The melodic but mesmerising club music has been fashioning a big and an undoubtedly dedicated fanbase.

Her Remix for Daniel Portman’s KHAWERI in 2010 got huge reactions from all global players, became   the   preferential  mix  of   the   single   and   launched   her   career as a producer. In 2011 her track YOU MAKE ME FLOAT hit Top50 of Beatport charts & made the cut onto legendary Buddha Bar Compilation. In fall 2012 she released AURELIA, which became a requested club hit and made it on various compilations. Her crossover chart hit COME WITH ME first saw lights in February 2013 and made its way up on top of Beatport charts, and remained in Top100 for over 7 months.

Booking: globalmusicbroadcasting@gmail.com

BIO:
In its earliest stages, Dr. Ozi was an imaginary friend; the figment of a child’s imagination. Giant, strong and extraordinary, Dr. Ozi could outrun cars and jump over buildings with ease. He was often seen flipping trucks, breaking branches and dangling from electrical wires. Like his creator, Dr. Ozi was unparalleled and unique. And like his creator, Dr. Ozi was never held down by expectations.

Since Dr. Ozi’s inception, Toronto-based Nix Chohan has been breaking molds and infiltrating dance floors with uniquely upbeat but relentless sounds of heavy synths and bass. And with releases on Buygore, Firepower and Uplink Audio Dr. Ozi has enjoyed recognition from bass music greats including Skrillex, Nero, Zomboy, Adventure Club & more.

Innovative in more than just his music production, the powerhouse artist has a great sense for the drama required of a live performance. Dr. Ozi has captivated the audiences of countless lauded nightclubs and international festivals such as WEMF and Medalla Light.

A proud force and trademark of Toronto’s talent, Dr. Ozi will continue to push boundaries and brighten dimly-lit clubs with his flashing, fast paced sound. Without a doubt, Dr. Ozi is on the way to becoming the next big act to come out of Toronto’s underground dance scene.",28076,148,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dr-Ozi/102937039789528,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dr-Ozi/102937039789528,http://twitter.com/#!/DrOziOfficial,http://www.youtube.com/droziofficial,"http://www.drozi.bandcamp.com

Dayne S

In a short space of time, German Dj, producer, comedian, pilot and guitarist Dayne S has turned a lot of heads thanks to his unqiue take on electronic music. He fell in love with the disco scene in his hometown during his teenage years. From there the next step was to start to DJing and now, in 2014, Dayne S is gathering more and more attraction by playing all over the world in countries like, Peru, Spain, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, Germany and more. 
The music he makes for labels like Stil Vor Talent, OFF, Noir and Semester have topped charts at both Beatport and DecksRecords. His versatile style ranges from slow and sultry, electronic blues, to more kicking and peak time. 
The future looks bright for Dayne, having had a No 1 Single in the Beatport's Genre Charts for more than 15 weeks. Rolling Stone Magazine impressively named him as an ""artitst you need to know for the future"".

Better known for the majorly successful, Gold selling ‘Clubland’ CD compilation album series, Mark gained notoriety with top twenty UK chart success after producing a string of hugely popular dance singles under his Breeze & Styles alias with equally celebrated DJ, Producer and long term production partner Darren Styles. He then went on to headline a number of sold out stadium arena sized events as part of All Around The World’s ‘Clubland’ Tour internationally. 
This would lead them to become producers, compilers and mixers of not one, but ten editions of the award winning UK compilation chart topping ‘Clubland X-Treme Hardcore’ CD album series for AATW and UMTV which to date has sold over a million copies. 
This of course goes hand in hand with Mark headlining well reputed events as a main stage DJ spanning a two decade period for promoters such as ‘EDC’, ‘WEMF’, ‘BCM’, ‘HTID’, ‘Hardcore Heaven’, ‘Slammin Vinyl’,and rave legend promoters ‘Dreamscape’,  ‘Helter Skelter’ & ‘Fusion’

Mark is also the pioneer and owner of cutting edge electronic dance and bass music record label FutureWorld, which represents a coalition of some of the most recognised and talented producers and artists of today and also allowing Mark to oversee, develop and mentor the breakthrough stars of tomorrow.

Multi Award Winning Producer / DJ & EDM Artist.
UK Top 20 Commercial success with 'You're Shining' & 'Heartbeatz' under Styles & Breeze
Co-Producer on the Number 4 Artist album 'Sky Divin' by Darren Styles.

Keys N Krates,Indie/Alternative,,http://soundcloud.com/keysnkrates,get@keysnkrates.com,"While it may look that way on stage, nothing is ever simple with Keys N Krates. Not when everyone has an equally valid opinion, along with the willingness (no, the all-consuming need) to sit and scrutinize a hearty 808 hit or laser like synth line for hours on end.

It's been this way since the very beginning, when Keys N Krates went from being a live hip-hop band reliant on rough acapellas and memory-jogging remixes to something much more complex - a tight-knit trio of producers/performers - Turntablist Jr Flo, Keyboard player David Matisse, drummer Adam Tune - who take rocking a party as seriously as a week spent in the studio. ""We always trade roles from song to song,"" explains Jr. Flo.  ""It's not uncommon for Matisse to flip a sample, or for me to write a melody, or for Tune to chime in on the mixing of a track. It's not the fastest way of working, but everyone has a say in everything.""

Which explains why their breakthrough singles (the elastic loops and diamond-edged drums of ""Dum Dee Dum,"" the head rush hooks of ""Treat Me Right,"" a frantic, D'n'B-flavored ""Are We Faded"") are able to pull the strings of packed festival crowds without resorting to tired EDM tropes. Hip-hop, house and UK bass music all play a role in a Keys N Krates record, but so do the dark-tinged dynamics and widescreen ways of indie acts like Caribou and M83. ""Seeing M83 live at the Osheaga festival changed our whole perception of how their music translates live,"" says Jr. Flo. ""The chord progressions are beautiful and catchy but never corny. It's pop music at its best.""

That was essentially the goal with the Toronto group's new Midnite Mass EP: cuts that are calibrated for clubs but that can translate beyond. Punchy and powerful. Emotional and epic. That goes for everything from its title track (an intro that sounds like a suspenseful thesis) to a Katy B collab (""Save Me"") that'll beam old-school ravers straight back to the '90s. And then there's something as deceivingly simple as ""Love Again,"" a soulful rap beat created from scratch and such artful details as the orchestral flourishes of Ouici and the gospel vocals of a friend named JP. Let's just say it's no coincidence that the song sounds like it sampled a dust-caked '70s record from a long-buried discount bin;  That Just Blaze or Kanye might find and flip, Keys N Krates want to leave you wondering just how they do it.     

“We wanted people to wonder where we got a lot of the sounds for this EP, the same way we have when listening to producers like Just Blaze and Timbaland.  Those guys have always used source samples or sounds that leave you scratching your head.  We love that simplicity; it's like true Italian cooking, a few ingredients to make something so impactful…. beats that leave you wondering 'where the fuck did he get that sound from?'

Originating from Colorado, Tempest got his start in music production at the young age of 17. He immersed himself in the dubstep world and made sure his name was known around the bass capital of the world, Denver.

Quickly mastering the fine arts of music production, it was only a matter of time before people started to take notice. Drawing inspiration from iconic figures such as Datsik, Zomboy and Bassnectar, Tempest has an ear for heavy, melodic driven basslines, crystal clear sound, and huge trunk rattling bass to top it all off. A sound so unique, that it has been noticed and played out by some of the biggest names in the scene such as Adventure Club, Eptic, Figure, Protohype, Party Favor, Kai Wachi and many more.

With Beatport releases charting on Ultragore Recordings and High Intensity Records, Tempest is only getting started. Having played alongside Barely Alive, Dodge & Fuski, Megalodon, Protohype, Vaski, Apashe, Big Chocolate, T-Mass, KTheory, Bar9, Luminox, HeRobust, The Frim, and more his live performances consist of precision deck control alongside carefully chosen track selection that will leave you in awe. Showing no sign of stopping anytime soon, Tempest hopes to establish himself in the music industry.

BIO:
Student dorms aren’t the usual catalyst for great musical achievements, but this is where Mark Haaxman and Lars Maasland — better known as LarryKoek — first started their own musical journey, and they haven’t looked back since.

After years of independent exploration, the LarryKoek duo formed in August 2014, and things have developed rather quickly, from signing with Dutch independent label ‘’Be Yourself Music’’, to reaching number #1 on Hypem with “Premiere Fois,” totaling two million plays on their SoundCloud profile, over three million plays on their Spotify channel and landing their first international gigs, the future is bright for these two Dutchmen.

With an impressive start thanks to their first official releases, the duo have made their name one of the most promising up and coming talents of the Netherlands. If you’ve ever heard LarryKoek play, you would know that they combine Deep House with guitar riffs, piano chords and funky baselines, to create a sound that makes people happy and dance for hours.

With several big gigs under their belt, such as ‘’Liebe Zur Musik’’ (CH), ''Lunacy'' (ES), Haus Mungsten (DE) and ‘’College Bal’’ (BE) LarryKoek is making headway in the Melodic House scene. Their last release ‘’Wonderlove’' brought a lot of attention on to them from their producer counterparts, to fans a like, receiving support from Bakermat, Tiësto, Lost Frequencies, Sam Feldt, Thomas Jack and more!

With lots of new releases on the way, 2016 is set to be a great year for Mark and Lars!",12627,33,http://facebook.com/LarryKoekDJ,http://facebook.com/LarryKoekDJ,http://twitter.com/LarryKoek,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFh4IOTpqDRgnhMzlqmic1g,"http://www.larrykoekdjs.com

Rising out of the Tel Aviv shoreline under the production moniker Khen, Hen Falah has generated enough heat during 2013 to burn white hot in the minds of the global DJ elite. Raised in the populous metropolitan city, Khen grew up listening to a variety of musical styles that would ultimately shape his own direction with laser guided focus and a steely determination to reach the upper echelons of the underground music scene. A prodigious talent that saw him first make music aged 11, would soon blossom into something extraordinary as he became familiar with the Tel Aviv club scene under the auspices of a talented elder brother.

Since his first productions hit fellow Israeli, Guy Mantzur’s Plattenbank imprint in 2011, Khen’s ascent has been nothing short of meteoric both in terms of respect earned and support garnered for his impressive production style. Beatport production credits in 2012 and 2013 have seen Khen’s status rise exponentially as he counts Denis A, Guy J, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo amongst his fans. Indeed, it is the latter that has played and charted almost all Khen’s work throughout 2013 on his world-renowned “Resident” show. From those opening tracks, Khen has gone on to grace the catalogues of the finest modern labels including Lowbit, Movement and Whose Haus in 2012 followed by Proton Music, Hope and Hernan Cattaneo’s Sudbeat in 2013. Chart success has been commensurate with talent as original productions such as “Moments Become Endless Time” and remixes including Nick Stoynoff’s “Berlin Dream” gain multiple entries in Beatport Top 100 charts and the recent “Thousand Mirrors” EP for Proton received to rapturous acclaim.

The clubs he once frequented to study the effect and dynamism of dance music have now become home to Khen’s considerable DJ talents. Tel Aviv’s “Cat & Dog”, “Shalvata” and “The Owl” have all played host to his skill and verve behind the decks as he tours throughout his Israeli homeland and beyond its shores to Europe and the 2013’s Amsterdam Dance Event. Furthermore, 2013 also saw the launch of the monthly Proton Radio show “Scales” as a further vehicle to spread his sounds and the musical knowledge accumulated through exposure to the global club scene. Already finding itself in the Proton Top 10 chart on numerous occasions, “Scales” is certain to build on its substantial successes thus far.

An unswerving dedication to his craft and an acute sense of production intelligence has seen Khen develop a musical wisdom far beyond his youthful exterior; set to expand still further in the coming months and years.

Booking: Jonathan@WaveformAgency.com

Say wassup: Contact@PsymbionicMusic.com

Cresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.

John Burcham has been moving bodies and turning heads as Psymbionic for several years in all corners of the USA, playing with acts such as Bassnectar, STS9, Big Gigantic, ill.Gates, Excision, EOTO, and Tipper. His passion and innovation in the music world are showcased through album releases on Muti Music and MalLabel, as well as in his role as label manager for the popular Electronic imprint Gravitas Recordings.

In a live show context, Psymbionic confronts mixes that are limited to the scope of the build and release, avoiding an industry epidemic of drop-monotony that overpowers the flow of music. Burcham seeks to prove that there are more powerful influences in moving a crowd than simple tension, providing an interwoven dynamic that relies on the strength of his blend, rather than the sole force or familiarity of the apex. 

Psymbionic's theory of music is a journey that doesn't visit the same place twice, building excitement for what's next not because you can anticipate it, but because you've never been there before.

Savage Society Founder // Arcane Records Co Founder

Salar Saeidi, a California native known by his better name of Blankface, has been running through the bass scene with his articulate sound since he began producing beats in late 2009. In 2013, Blankface and MAZE, Arthur Darbinyan, founded their label, Savage Society, an artist collective of young, divergent producers that are making heads turn within the bass community with their eminently dynamic sound.

Currently residing in Orange County, California, Blankface has been up to no good, plotting his most vicious attack on the bass scene, producing some of the most savage dubstep bass culture has ever heard. The 23-year-old gathers inspiration from artists, such as Coki, Jakes, Subfiltronik, and Kromestar, and utilizes his own skills and creative mind as his weapon of choice to muster an influential onslaught of tracks that riddle and inject shock stricken bodies with sub-bass. With support from 12th Planet, Jakes, Shiverz, & many more, everyone will undoubtedly want to keep an eye, or an ear, out for this young and talented innovative producer.

It was in 2009 that everything really starts when he won a competition for production and that he signed at the same time his first EP on French label Disturbed Mind Records since he continues his way into production and is signed in under other labels...

Da Vinci hears of this warrior with the illest technique and decides to venture into the outer realm of the enchanted hills

~ Don Da Vinci  ~ Seattle, Sandpoint . .Live from the Dojo - Producer / Artist  - After surviving a near fatal plane crash off the shores of Tahiti, the sole survivor Don Da Vinci at the tender age of 4 began to display extraordinary abilities.  Flying was the first of many that he learned through out his life.  One night as he was sleeping his body would begin to float to the ceiling.  After years of practice and meditation he discovered how to make his reality a dream - thus applying the vise verse effect causing an eq conundrum.  At 13 he mastered reality manipulation and telepathy plus he received his black belt in quantum theory's at Wu University. Around the age of 18 or 19 he was practicing the art of de-materializing and re-materializing matter (Teleporting/Time Travel) when he accidentally ventured to far into the abyss. . where time was yellow and gravity was green. .the land of the gods. .years passed. .no word from da vinci. . where was he. . what new styles was he learning. .for some time it was believed that he was never to be seen again. . that is. . until now

So ahead of his time many though he was speaking a new or unknown language- the language of future thot- futurizm - the heavens honored him  with one of the key roles in helping with the building of the foundation- for these EQ brothers have been through many past lives and countless journeys preparing them for today-

14KT,Indie/Alternative,K T,http://soundcloud.com/14kt,Jeff@asideworldwide.com,"Ypsilanti, Michigan’s own golden child, Kendall Tucker, bka 14KT, is a multi-talented Artist/Producer/DJ. His musical roots came from growing up singing in the church choir. It was there and by studying his parent’s jazz and soul records, along with piano and upright bass lessons, Kendall learned the fundamentals of music.

14KT got his start as 1/7th of this mighty Hip-hop collective, The Athletic Mic League. He started out as an emcee, inspired by the sounds of Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, Gangstarr, A Tribe Called Quest and Outkast. Finding it hard to get instrumental beats, KT started using the “Pause/Play/Record” method, by looping breaks on cassette tapes so the crew could rap over them. 

14KT’s solo career began in 2008. After a rich history with AML, he entered and won his first beat battle competition, in Red Bull Big Tune Detroit. Later that year, he released his debut instrumental LP, “The Golden Hour [Soundtrack].” The Golden Hour made its mark appearing on many year-end “top albums” lists. Okayplayer said “this is the sort of striking project that can singlehandedly create an artists following.” And so it did.

14KT is the last Big Tune national champion, which he went on to win in 2010.
He’s worked with the likes of Aloe Blacc, Black Milk, Bun B, Danny Brown, Elzhi, Jay Electronica, JMSN, Masta Ace, Mayer Hawthorne, Legendary Motown Funk Brothers guitarist Dennis Coffey and many others. His music was featured in the DVD for Michael Rapaport’s A Tribe Called Quest documentary, “Beats, Rhymes, & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest.” Live, he’s rocked with the Stones Throw crew, at Low End Theory, SXSW, on tour with Mayer Hawthorne, Slum Village, and across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia.

To date, 14KT has released five solo albums, as well as his collaborative R&B/Soul album, “Saturn Return” with singer/songwriter AB, and “The Big Knock”, together with Mayer Hawthorne as the “Beat Wave” group Jaded Incorporated [Universal Republic/Casablanca Records]. Jaded Incorporated was born out of their mutual adoration for the Post-Punk and New Wave music of the early 1980′s, and Ghettotech music in the 90′s Detroit scene.

14KT continues to explore this electronic realm with his sixth solo release, Elelator, coming October 2015.

Heist,Indie/Alternative,Jim Muir,http://soundcloud.com/heist,jon@urbanagency.co.,"to book heist   
jon@urbanagency.co.uk

With continual support from industry heavyweights including Goldie, Friction, Noisia, Fabio, Grooverider, Hype, Hazard, Fresh, Annie Mac, Mista Jam, Dillinja, Logan D, Majistrate, Original Sin, Bailey, Taxman, Guv and plenty more, Heist’s spot in the limelight has been deservedly cemented in recent times.
Established as a DJ for over 17 years, Heist started producing tracks 14 years ago. In That Time hes produced tracks on many labels, including Logan D's Low Down Deep, Goldie's Metal Headz, DJ Hype's Playaz Records, Mampi Swift's Charge Records, Roni Size's Full Cycle, Shy Fx's Digital Sound Boy, V Recordings, Philly Blunt, Frontline, Propaganda amongst others, along with his own imprints Sumo Beatz, Co-Lab & Calypso. Being Influenced by all styles of Drum & Bass from the start, Heist’s incredibly adaptable production style has seen his tunes find themselves into a variety of big name’s DJ boxes across the scene, together with the compliment of being sound engineer to Goldie’s productions (Also as Rufige Kru) for the last 6 years. Expertly balancing a long line of ambitious production projects with his first love of DJing, Heist continues to play out across the UK and Europe, America and Australia to an ever-increasing fan base. 

In a welcome diversion from the antisocial Drum & Bass stereotype, Heist has also come into his own as a personality in the music owing to a volume of media coverage pushing him into the public consciousness.The Sumo Beatz Podcast (Available on iTunes) offers a great insight into the variety of what Heist plays in DJ Sets. Also an appearance in Drum & Bass literary Mecca Knowledge Magazine providing invaluable knowledge for their ‘Studio Tips’ section was followed by demand for his DJ work at competing publication ATM, laying down a mix with award-winning MC Funsta. Further publicity has seen him interviewed for Drum & Bass Arena TV from his very own studio, also DJing on Drum & Bass TV LIVE many times with people like Harry Shotta, Skibbadee, Funsta and others. Add to that appearances on BBC Radio 1, Ministry Of Sound, Kiss FM and BBC 1Xtra where he held his own alongside superstars Grooverider, Bryan G, DJ Hype and Bailey. 

Heist has raised the bar over time with a number of exciting collaborations and re-workings, ever conscious of a desire to improve his own already formidable skills. These include a remixes for Roni Size, Pendulum, Talay Riley, Stooshe and Josh Kumra. Also Engineering Remixes alongside Goldie for Calvin Harris, Ed Sheeran, Joker and legendary Stone Roses front man, Ian Brown.Further work alongside Goldie has seen him engineer hugely well-received LPs Malice in Wonderland and Memoirs of an Afterlife for the Metalheadz boss, together with A Recent new Goldie Track Called 'Freedom' which was supported on BBC Radio 1 by Ferne Cotton, Pete Tong, Zane Low, Trevor Nelson, Mista Jam to name a few. Meanwhile, Heist has Also worked on Collaborations with artists like Taxman, Majistrate, Crissy Criss, Serum and many more with new possible co lab options looming.",21939,172,http://www.facebook.com/JimHeist,http://www.facebook.com/JimHeist,http://twitter.com/JimHeist,http://www.youtube.com/user/Heistdnb,"https://colabrecordings.databeats.com

BOOKINGS: jon@globalmusicbroadcasting.com

Emerging from deep within the jungles of Richfield, Ohio is Tyler Swan aka Lord Swan3x. Swan is known for his overly aggressive bass music productions, and for being on the forefront of the brutally heavy bass music scene movement. Co-owner alongside Code: Pandorum of the newly formed heavy bass music label “Crowsnest”, Swan has aspirations to launch the heavy scene to even higher realms and is proving this with every step he makes. 2015 has proven to be a huge year, with debuts in Paris, France and Montreal, Quebec. The tail end of 2014 and beginning of 2015 showed the releases “Megaton EP” and “Sudden Death EP” reaching #9 and #5 respectively on the Beatport Dubstep Releases chart. In October of 2015 “The Armory EP” was released on Prime Audio and went straight in at #2 on the same chart within one day. Swan is set to continue his drive of heavy bass music straight through 2016 and onward. Prepare yourselves for the wrath of the Swan.

The DJ and producer duo Yin Yang Bangers was formed in 2012 by Arthith and Simon, both who worked on individual projects before. Arthith started his musical journey at the young age of 13. He experimented with mash-ups and mixing instrumentals together. Couple of years later he taught himself how to produce music. At the beginning Arthith made a lot of Hip Hop music, later he remixed some Pop music and many years after that he discovered the House music scene. As both Simon and Arthith were school friends, they talked a lot about music and so their taste in music grew closer together. They were both fascinated by dance music, it’s culture and the variety of sub-genres it had to offer. Simon started his own mash-ups and got into producing with Arthith’s help. Eventually they both teamed up to create the DJ-duo Yin Yang Bangers, as we know them today. A project that started off in mainly producing Big Room tracks (which was popular at that time) helped them develop their taste in music towards what they’re known for today: “melodic, melancholic & euphoric Progressive House music”. They have been supported by many DJs/producers from all over the globe such as: Hardwell, Blasterjaxx, Borgeous, Tommie Sunshine, Tom Swoon and many many more. Their musical journey will be something to look out for!",10467,29,http://www.facebook.com/yinyangbangers,http://www.facebook.com/yinyangbangers,http://twitter.com/yinyangbangers,,"http://www.yinyangbangers.com

Egyptian born and raised Mohamed Ragab has been making quite a name for himself the past few years. Having been active in the Trance scene both as DJ and producer for almost a decade, releasing his tracks on renowned labels like Future Sound of Egypt/Armada and Ultra Music, and having received multiple support on Armin van Buuren’s A State Of Trance radioshow as well as Aly & Fila’s FSOE it may have come as no surprise that he was invited to play A State of Trance Festival in Utrecht (Netherlands) earlier this year. His long awaited collaboration with Paul van Dyk “My World” was announced soon after and got released on Paul van Dyk’s album The Politics of Dancing Vol. 3 in May 2015.

Not resting on his success, Mohamed is currently working on new material and has the Aly & Fila FSOE 400 tour to look forward to this summer. Not only will he be entertaining Trance crowds in Argentina, Australia and Poland and Czech Republic, he is also part of the line up of the final event of the tour, which will take place at the world famous Giza Pyramids in September. Situated in his hometown, this once in a lifetime event will be a dream come true for Mohamed and make the tour come full circle.

With more exciting projects on the way, there really is no denying it; we will see a lot more coming from Mohamed Ragab in the near future.",11809,57,http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=518440542,http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=518440542,http://twitter.com/MohamedRagab,,,14,Nat@twenty4sevenmanagement.comragab.bookings@gmail.com

When it comes to change, you either get on board or get left behind. No one knows this more than MING. Flipping the script is second nature to this New Yorker. In a city with an ever-changing soundscape, MING remains versatile and adept: essentially a way of life for the producer, songwriter, remixer, DJ, and musician.
In the mid-90s, he was one-half of the pioneering electronic duo MING+FS. Playing guitar, bass, keyboard, and turntables, MING toured the world and gave international audiences an introduction to electronic music, opening up for acts like Sting, RUN-DMC, and Moby.
Over the last decade, MING has pulled the studio more into focus, while still keeping a hand in the touring life. He remixed singles for a star-studded lineup including Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, and Black Eyed Peas. His original tracks climbed the charts, scoring four Top 40 trap remixes on Beatport. Collaborations on singles like “Disintegration” from Le Castle Vania for deadmau5’s Mau5trap label and “King Kong” for Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak Records staked claim on dancefloors worldwide. MING received a Grammy nomination in 2014 for the remix of Crossfingers’ “Falling Out” (featuring Danny Losito).
No doubt you’ve heard MING at the club or festival, but his work continues to percolate elsewhere. Habitat Music—MING’s music production company—supplies original music to the advertising, film, and television industries. Some of his work has been featured on TV shows such as CBS’s “CSI: Miami” and “CSI: NY,” HBO’s “Sex and the City,” and Showtime’s “Weeds.” Brands like Sears, Nissan, Chevy, Burger King, Nokia, AT&T and Doritos have also leveraged MING’s cutting-edge sound for their global advertising campaigns.
MING continues to break through in 2016: MING Presents Warmth, which will solely focus on house music, can be heard on Dash Radio, the Main Stage channel of dl.fm, and Future.fm and his mixes now appear on Music Choice, America’s premier music and video on demand provider. Each month, listeners will hear new releases and remixes on the Hood Famous Music label, plus club dates updated on the regular.
Expect a lot of exciting news in 2016 from MING. Make sure you keep up!

Zwette,Indie/Alternative,DJ / Producer / Remixer,http://soundcloud.com/zwette,booking@dj-zwette.de,"BIO -►

His sets and style are characterized by fine grooves, charming melodies and catchy vocals. He mixes together fresh club sounds with never forgotten classic pieces - a catchy style that makes the crowds want to get movin’ on the dance floor! Everyone who has been lucky to listen to him knows what we are talking about. His fine taste for music, paired with a good hand for the mixing technique, make his sets truly remarkable and recognizable. Zwette is blessed with that special talent to pick the right record at the right moment. Just what the party crowds want! And he rocks the clubs over and over again with his fresh sounds. His gig at the Sonne Mond und Sterne Wintercircus 2002 festival and a resident job at the recently opened OGS Club in Jena, Eastern Germany, served as springboard for his career. He is receiving a large number of booking requests from central German clubs and event organizers. As one of the outcomes he has supported prominent greats such as TokTok, Elektrochemie LK, The Discoboys, Lexy & K-Paul, Horny United, Milk & Sugar and many more. In 2004, he performed at the Camp Music in the Motopark Oschersleben and, in the same year, he landed his biggest gig so far at the legendary Sonne Mond Sterne festival at the Bleilochtalsperre Saalburg! In the following years, he played in many hip clubs in Germany and abroad. He dedicated himself more and more to the quieter sounds, not only at the tables but also in his role as a producer just starting out. At the beginning of 2013, he chose a relatively unknown song for a remix/edit that he came across by chance listening to the radio in his car. When he produced this remix (actually, just for fun) and for himself based on Tom Odell’s song  “Another Love”, no one would have thought this would turn out to be a worldwide hit! Maybe for coincidence and with a little bit of luck was he able to make it all the way to the top when the trendy You Tube channel’s “The Sound You Need“ attention was drawn to the edit which was then placed on their page. The number of clicks onto Zwette’s Soundcloud and the TSYN page rapidly rose – indication enough that something big was waiting in the wings. Very soon several million people had listened to the song, and Zwette became more and more known. As of December 2014 the song boasted with the proud figure 63 million clicks on the TSYN alone! This success won him many interesting booking and remix requests from all over the world. Zwette played gigs Dubai, Portugal, Ireland, France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland. He performed as a guest at many festivals in Germany and abroad, such as Panoramas, Boom, SonneMondSterne, Rock’n’Heim, Sputnik Springbreak and many more. However, 2014 was not only his year of success as a DJ but also as a producer with remixes for greats such as Klangkarussell, Ayla, Bipolar Sunshine, Alle Farben, Kelvin Jones, Milk & Sugar, Jake Isaac, Dawid Podsiadlo among many others. His first own single “Rush” will be out in February 2015 at the Spinnin‘ Deep label!

After 5 months of practice night after night complex had his first set on... pirate radio on DEMAND 91.6FM based in essex, as time went by confidence grew and it was clear this was no phase.
9 months on and DEMAND FM was no more, a demo was sent on to CHARGE 90.8FM which proved to be successful. after becoming the youngest dj on the station at the time complex became more at ease with hosting shows and brought in dj demize to go back to back with week in week out, after alot of hard work and time complex was doing shows on his own again prime time on sundays. This was where he was joined by such mc's as flight, flexmus, rhymes, blade, dynamo, terror, rogue and mc decoy who he still works with to this day. guest shows on FORCE FM, KOOL FM and a past weekly show on ORIGIN FM all sent him on his way to gain more experience, shows on ORIGINAL 90.6FM & PLANETDNBLIVE.CO.UK complex and mc decoy are quickly built a solid reputation playing accross the country and worldwide.

Native New Yorker, Mitchell Ulitsky, also known as Mitchell Frederick, has had a life long passion for music. His musical upbringing began as a child, where he discovered his love of music through playing many musical instruments such as the trombone, piano, guitar, and bass. At the ripe age of 14, Mitchell began to draw upon his musical talents as well as his inspirations in order to turn his passion into something more tangible: becoming a DJ. After about a year of practicing everyday on his first DJ setup, Mitchell finally decided that he was ready to take on the night clubs. Over the years, Mitchell Frederick has played at countless venues all over New York and South Florida. He has made many trips back and forth between New York and Florida to spread his love for music to the masses.

Mitchell has a passion for producing tracks that help give his sets a very unique energy. Always being ahead of the game with the newest music out and knowing what the crowd wants to hear before they hear it are special abilities that set Mitchell apart from the others. His sets are always full of surpirses because he makes many of his own edits and mash ups that he doesn't release to the public.

Lushington,Indie/Alternative,,http://soundcloud.com/lushingtonmusic,ollie@broodmgmt.co,"Producer and DJ, Lushington has a bright future ahead of him in dance music.

Originally from Preston, he has been honing his production and DJ skills from an early age. The past 12 months have been spent refining his sound, building up a loyal and fanatical following across social media, specifically Soundcloud.

His sound immediately draws you in… piano and bass driven with honest  house vocals.

Bio:
Since I was young I like music. Two years ago in the summer holidays I visited an Electronic Music Festival with some friends, called ""Sonne Mond Sterne"". I got in contact with different forms of electronic music and I decided to produce my own tracks, remix music and play DJ sets. But the roots of making music go back to my childhood. I played 3 years of flute and 5 years the piano. The project ""George Whyman"" was born. Music is a balance to everyday life for me now. It makes me very happy if people like my music and support it. I love it when the music touches my soul. That's my definition of music.",15681,26,https://www.facebook.com/georgewhymanmusic,https://www.facebook.com/georgewhymanmusic,,,"https://www.georgewhyman.de

ENGLISH:
There are two features that define Oscar Aguilera’s work as a DJ and artist: passion and dedication. OA is a true worker of the electronic scene, which has made himself a place on the local and international scene based on showing his quality continuously with love towards what he does. He is also a powerful performer, who delivers outstanding sets expelling great physical and musical energy in a natural way. And last, he is a producer who is winning, disc by disc and hit by hit, his moment in the competitive world of techno production.
Oscar Aguilera started his professional career as a DJ in the year 2005 with his residency in La Terraza Barcelona, one of the earliest and most legendary house-clubs in Spain, where he stayed until 2011. On that moment he took the leap into the prestigious Enter Group, which took him to hold simultaneous residencies in clubs such as Florida 135 and elrow (in Row14, Poble Espanyol in Barcelona, in Space Ibiza and Fabrik in Madrid) and Monegros Festival, where he played for 4 years in a row and starred the epic closing in the year 2012, in front of 25.000 attendees, and which it is still the most viewed video of the festival.
As a producer, Oscar has worked with multiple labels, self-owned and international. He started with more house-focused labels such as “Travelling Soul Recordings” (which was started by himself in 2009), Soul Of Life (also self-owned, from 2010 to 2011), Lapsus Music, Darkroom Dubs (the label of Silicone Soul), Nervous (from Todd Terry), Suerte, Asymetric Recordings... Until he opted lately for his releases under the most featured labels from the tech-house and techno universe, such as Elevate (from Pig&Dan), 100%Pure / Bitten (from 2000 And One), MKT (from Markantonio), Deeperfect (from Stefano Noferini), Stick Recordings (from Alberto Ruiz), La Pera Records... His first remix was part of the Top 50 sales in Beatport House, and since then, his Tops have continued.

￼￼
All this work have won him several recognitions from the Spanish media, such as nominations as “Best Artist of the Year for the Public” or “Best Tech-House DJ” in Vicious Awards, or full TV shows, such as his recent documentary “Beyond Oscar Aguilera” in Wattshake TV. Furthermore, this has also granted him with a continuous international presence in clubs where he has played and plays, which special impact in Europe. In the late years, and only to mention a few, he has played in France (Inox, La Villa Rouge, Queen), Italy (Fabrique Milan, Old River Park, Napoli), Germany (Cocoon Club), United Kingdom (Back to Basics, Sankeys, Digital), Belgium (Café D’Anvers), Romania (Studio Martin), Norway, Portugal, The Netherlands... Even crossing the Atlantic ocean towards the latin american market: Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica...
With the arrival of 2015, Oscar Aguilera has gone a step forward in his career and has started new projects, more personal and ambitious as ever. While he keeps a frenetic activity as a DJ and producer, he is preparing for the release of his own brand “Alive”, with which he is recently announcing his first own parties in his city-based Barcelona, and with which, in the future, he threatens to publish his own music.",20740,68,http://www.facebook.com/OscarAguileraOfficial,http://www.facebook.com/OscarAguileraOfficial,http://twitter.com/OscarAguileradj,http://www.youtube.com/user/oscaraguileratv,"http://www.be-at.tv/brands/off-sonar/elrow/drumcode/oscar-aguilera.go

BIO

Moon Boots entered the world in the mid-1980s via Cape Canaveral. After years of service as the preferred footwear of celebrity astronauts (notably Tom Hanks), Moon Boots came to life during a classified experiment aboard the International Space Station. Little is known of what actually transpired aboard the shuttle, but in short, Moon Boots became a sentient creature, equipped with reason, intuition, and groove. Before long, he grew tired of working for the space-military-industrial complex and found solace in the soothing sounds of underground disco and R&B boogie records. He knew it was only of matter of time before he was hung up like so many boots before him. He abandoned the program and used his savings to build a studio in an unnamed location, where he is currently working.",93399,93,http://www.facebook.com/moonbootsmusic,http://www.facebook.com/moonbootsmusic,http://www.twitter.com/moonbootsmusic,,"http://www.moonbootsmusic.com

Management: contact@paperthinrecords.co.uk

Kiks and Amber Clara, the London-duo better known as July Child are a soulful, ambient pop group. Drawn together by their 80s and 90s urban influences, along with sharing the exact same birthday, their musical collaboration was inevitable. 

It was their haunting, yet uplifting rework of 2013 dancefloor classic 'C O O L' by Le Youth that really started garnering interest from both sides of the pond. The group released their debut single 'When You Call' on Armada's unique imprint 'The Bearded Man' and continued releasing more upbeat, tropical house covers and remixes of classic childhood favourites; Kevin Lyttle's 'Turn Me On' and Sonique's 'So Good', again gaining huge global interest. The duo are keen to release more of their original material that they have been meticulously crafting over the last 18 months, along with playing shows all around the world with their four-piece live band.",7088,65,http://www.facebook.com/julychilduk,http://www.facebook.com/julychilduk,http://twitter.com/JulyChildMusic,https://www.youtube.com/user/julychildmusic,"http://www.julychild.com

Blackout / Eatbrain / RAM / Lifted Music / Titan / Bad Taste / Position Chrome / Program

Over the past few years L 33's intricate production skills have helped place Bulgaria firmly on the D&B world map.
His impressive back catalogue has seen releases on highly respected labels such as Program (RAM) Eatbrain, Rise audio, Titan, Bad Taste and Lifted Music.
Supported by the the likes of Andy C, DJ Hype, Dillinja & many more, this 21 years old is a producer to look out for.
There's so much more to come from L 33 and those signature dark and futuristic vibes certainly won't disappoint

In 2013, releasing his track ""Discrete"" as a part of Andy C Nightlife 6 compilation took him to another level.
Getting involved with RAM records helped him putting out his debut single on Andy C's sub imprint - Program.

The year 2014 brought him big success after releasing his single Melt/Let Loose on Addictive Behaviour. 
The tracks are still being supported by some of the biggest names out. 
The end of the year was exciting for him, after signing his track ""Saviour"" exclusively on D&B Arena 18 Album.

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Spanish producer extraordinaire Rayko has been a leading light in the disco scene since 2008, the year he launched his magnificent Rare Wiri imprint. 

Since then his name has appeared on literally dozens of great records scattered across labels like Eskimo, Is It Balearic? and Nang. 

Deeply rooted in '70s and '80s disco, funk, boogie and rock, Rayko's influences are masterfully interpreted and transformed into modern day dancefloor bombs. 

His mind-blowing edit of Candi Staton's 'Broadway' came in at number 1 in Juno's best of 2011 disco chart, proving he's right at the crest of the disco edit wave.

But his talents don't stop there. He's delved into original productions and remixes, being asked to lend his skilled hand to tracks by Psychemagik, Ajello, or Ilya Santana, to name a few,... 

As a DJ, he's been shipped over to the USA, Africa, Asia,  South and North America and all around Europe, and his global following is quite obviously illustrated by his massive following on SoundCloud.

As the months go on and his catalogue expands, Rayko is rapidly becoming one of the most loved names in modern day disco.

Direct descendent from the legendary poseidon, ruler of the 7 seas, and rogue wave alchemist; Tropicool, now prowls beach towns plundering booty while searching for the illest tuneage, previously thought to be locked away, buried deep in ancient chests. His origins are mysterious, although we know he has had a powerful hand in the rebirth of disco here in america. His highly sought after tune selection and euphoria induced events have been nothing short of legendary, always a few steps ahead of the curve and enjoyed by all; even your foreign step-sister. The vibes are always best served with a cocktail umbrella, which are soulful, yet funky numbers, infused with disco and deep sexy tones. Tropicool is a feeling, not a sound.

With a penchant for well-crafted melodies, crisp drum grooves, bold bass lines and infectious hooks, Poupon has really hit his stylistic stride. His ability to seamlessly merge the emotive delicacies of Pop & R&B with the raw energy of dance floor minded house music is what truly sets him apart. This has become evident in his growing repertoire of original production, remixes and edits.

Poupon has been on a solid trajectory since his first release in 2011 on Miami-based label Petfood. In 2012, he teamed up with Montreal house duo, Prince Club, to pump out two widely successful collaborative EP's (""Platinum"" & ""The Block"" / ""Technique"") on Riva Starr's mainstay, Snatch! Records. These releases garnered support from industry heavyweights and were no stranger to Beatport's Top 100 Deep House & House charts.

2013 saw Poupon stretch his wings creatively with successful releases on the legendary NYC house staple, Nurvous Records and Mark Knight's iconic Toolroom Records. The collaborative ""Only One"" EP with Prince Club is still being discovered, enjoyed and in steady rotation more than a year after release - quite an accomplishment in today's dance music landscape. Both tracks were handpicked by the masterful MK to be included in his ""In The House"" compilation for Defected, and the B-side ""Before"" found it's way onto BBC Radio 1 & Ministry of Sound Radio on quite a few occasions.

Towards the end of the year, Poupon made the decision to relocate from his hometown of Toronto to Amsterdam, where he is currently based. Since making the move across the pond, he has been billed at legendary venues such as Ministry of Sound in London, Club Bonsoir in Bern, Sin Nightclub in Dublin, and Amsterdam Dance Event. His sets are energetic, thoughtfully selected and always filled with fresh & exciting tracks which can be experienced in both live performances and his mix series ""Cooked Up"".

WIth 2014 underway, Poupon has hit the ground running. Atlantic Records called upon him to put his spin on R&B superstar, Janelle Monáe's single ""What Is Love"". A collaborative Prince Club & Poupon edit of Route 94's hit ""My Love"" has racked up nearly over 250,000 plays on Youtube & Soundcloud. His forthcoming release on Australian label Sweat It Out! has already garnered early support from the likes of Cyril Hahn, Tensnake & Breach and is set to be a certified summer bomb. Clearly, there are no signs of slowing down for this budding producer & DJ.",5006,92,http://facebook.com/callmepoupon,http://facebook.com/callmepoupon,http://twitter.com/callmepoupon,http://www.youtube.com/poupondj,,8,amar@emvtalents.comlailley@emvtalents.comlindsay@mn2s.comjermayne@rivalmg.com

“Support from industry heavyweights abound, The Him’s penchant for sultry remixes is on display...and the results showcase a duo whose name is ascending with every free download.” - Aaron Berecz for Dancing Astronaut

Hailing from Amsterdam, The Him is a music production duo (aka Jeroen & Steven) creating buzz with their smash hit singles, official remixes and monthly Midnight Mixtapes. Gaining inspiration from artists like Daft Punk, Duke Dumont, Empire of the Sun and The Chemical Brothers, The Him's sound is an infectious union of indie, deep house, nu disco and pop – full of fresh, experimental and sometimes tropical beats bound to make you move and wanting more.

With an exclusive premiere on Dancing Astronaut, their latest single “Feels Like Home” quickly hit #1 on SoundCloud’s Deep House chart, went viral on Spotify, claimed #4 on DMC’s Buzz chart and garnered more than 3 million plays in only one month on their SoundCloud page. The single, featuring the smooth vocals of up-and-comer Son Mieux, continues to attract international attention from magazines, bloggers and fans alike, with interviews and special mentions from EDM Sauce, Your EDM, DJ Mag NL, MrSuicideSheep, EDMTunes and countless more. Heralded as a “Dutch masterpiece” by radio 538 legend Wessel van Diepen, “Feels Like Home” is the 3rd official single from The Him, after two chart-topping collaborations with famed DJ/music producer Sam Feldt. In addition to their singles , Jeroen and Steven have also dropped official remixes for the likes of The ChainSmokers, Otto Knows, Shift K3y, Shaun Frank, Adrian Lux, Solomon Grey, and Dotan.

Their Midnight Mixtapes, featuring the latest deep house tracks - including their own - continue to grow each month. With over 60,000 avid followers on SoundCloud, amassing millions of plays, The Him is also supported and played by the some of the world’s biggest DJs including: Tiësto, Felix Jaehn, Oliver Heldens, Don Diablo, The Chainsmokers, Sam Feldt, and more. Cementing their position in the dance music scene and blossoming in their creations, The Him are most certainly artists to keep an eye on over the next year.

BL3R BIOGRAPHY

""The last person to do that was Zedd"" – the last line of the email from Beatport letting Phil Chang and Jon Ney know they had won their second official remix competition in 2014… but who wants to talk about last year.

In 2015, BL3R have scored another Beatport Top 10 with their monster Carnage collaboration ‘Jumpoff’, hit the iTunes Dance USA Top 10 with their face-ripping Gareth Emery Remix and signed with power-house Spinnin’ Records. Their debut release ‘Heat‘ scored 500,000 Soundcloud streams in a week and DJ support for BL3R‘s club facing blends of big room, progressive and trap reads like an Ultra main-stage flyer:  Hardwell, Carnage, The Chainsmokers, DVLM, W&W, Skrillex etc. They’ve had an EDM.com #1 , a cumulative 3 million plays on their Soundcloud, and a merchandise launch which sold-out in a day. 

The hype, is very real. The world wants more, and BL3R are going to give it. Hard.

There is something big brewing down in Melbourne; An underground club phenomenon that is bubbling away and surfacing upon the clubs and dancefloors worldwide. A sound, a vibe and a culture created around an energetic and unique ethos.
One of the bright shining stars of it all is a young and talented DJ/Producer by the name of Djuro. Known to his mum as Mitchell Browne, Djuro is at the forefront of this massive new movement displaying an enormous amount of talent and skill at such a young age.
Initially starting his love affair with music via the path of metal and hardcore in year 7, it was very evident early on that Djuro’s destiny and path in life was to be affiliated with music. As the years progressed Djuro consistently evolved always looking for that new and insightful sound that would keep him on his toes as both an avid music fan and more so an artist. This constant search led him to the bright and wonderful work of electronic music where he was mesmerised by artists such as Boys Noize, Proxy, The Bloody Betroots and more. It was at this time that Djuro really began to focus and hone in on production.
Fast forward only a couple of years and Djuro is a name on the lips of many. Championing a club friendly electro sound that is currently taking over the clubs worldwide, Djuro has plenty of Originals and Remixes under his belt. The most notable is his remix of Contiez ft. TreyyG – Trumpsta which has been absolutely smashed from coast to coast, Charted at 14 on Beatport’s Electro House Chart, and been one of the most well received club tracks of 2013 so far.
Djuro is a prime example of the modern day artist – A young, hungry and talented producer & DJ who works tirelessly at not just a sound, but a dance music revolution.",37653,257,https://www.facebook.com/djuro.official,https://www.facebook.com/djuro.official,http://twitter.com/djuromusic,,,14,chris@onehitagency.comraye@onehitagency.com

PHW | PHW Elements,Hip-Hop,,http://soundcloud.com/progressivehouseworldwide,demos@progressivehouseworldwide.com,"Progressive House Worldwide was launched as a label in October 2012, after years of being one of the leading forces in the promoting and blogging business of deep & melodic electronic music. 

We are happy to see that our main label, often just by the name PHW, today has become an expansive and respected label for the progressive house and trance sounds we have supported so much in the past. 
We hope you love the melodic wonders we present on this label, just as much as we do ourselves.

Or should anyone be interested in venturing into the deeper or darker aspects of electronic dance music, don't forget to investigate PHW Elements, a brand new label founded early 2014, which offers diverse, deep and experimental sounds for a wide amount of listeners. 

Any feedback on the music we release? We'd love to hear from as many of you as possible!



Thank you from all of us in the
Progressive House Worldwide family!

_________________________________________________
It's been roughly 5 years of dedicated producing and Benasis has already begun to leave his permanent footprint in the steadily growing Bass Music scene.  He's accomplished so much in such a short period of time.  After winning a highly competitive Beatport Remix Competition for Skint Records legendary music producer, ""Freq Nasty"", he broadened his following greatly.  His remix of the reggae influenced Freq Nasty track ""Not Givin In"" went on to make top 10 of the top 100 dubstep charts of Major Online Electronic Dance Music store ""Track It Down"".  He's received support from not only Skint Records Freq Nasty but also Proper Pedigrees big time Trap Duo Watapachi, heRobust, Kid Kamillion, Dirty South Joe, and Kennedy Jones. 

After Benasis gained attention from his release on Skint Records, he was approached by Konfront Records to do a four track EP entitled ""RUID"" or Rage Until I Die which also went on to do well among the masses. Soon Benasis would hold his own remix competition of his track ""Whatcha Gon Do"".  The competition itself received 30 amazing remixes created by talented music producers from all over the world. 

Benasis quickly continues to push forward with his talented and creative innovation of Bass Music.  In March 2014 he went on to win a coveted competition for top Trap Song with INDABA MUSIC for his song ""Atom Bomb ""which is now available in there licensing catalog. On December 18, 2014 Benasis took the  center stage with the win of Guitar Center's Your Next Record with Steve Aoki! Benasis was hand picked by Steve Aoki from over 7,000 entries from all over the country. This win along with his consistent drive and passion and with an ever growing fan base (over 87k followers on soundcloud) will surely make Benasis one to watch for in 2015.",89820,363,http://www.facebook.com/JULIANBENASIS,http://www.facebook.com/JULIANBENASIS,http://twitter.com/officialbenasis,https://www.youtube.com/user/DJJBENASIS,"http://www.jango.com/stations/356544109/tunein

BIO :

POINT.BLANK

Probably the artist that has single-handedly pioneered the filthy dubstep sound in Belgium, 
and has been picked up by all of the major players, is Point.Blank. 
Initially made up of two people, now there’s only Matar at the controls, 
and he has turned the Point.Blank sound into an instantly recognisable dancefloor-minded attack, 
aimed squarely at your feet!
With numerous releases under his belt on underground labels such as 
Dubsaw, Prime Adio, Ultragore, Betamorph, 2 Much Bass and Dub All or Nothing, 
his hard-as-nails sound has been getting caned by the likes of Borgore, Habstrakt, Eptic 
among many others.",27334,75,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pointblank/103366219700580,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pointblank/103366219700580,http://twitter.com/PointBlank_dub,http://youtube.com/user/PointBlankDub,,2,info@them-apples-agency.compointblankdub@gmail.com

Hailing from Perth the epicenter of the Australasian drum and bass scene, ShockOne aka Karl Thomas origins started in a band with Rob & Gareth from Pendulum, through to his recent assault on drum and bass dance floors worldwide, his musical energy and expression is powerful to say the least.

The beginning of the new year will see ShockOne drop his debut album ‘Universus’. With the first two smash singles from the album ‘Crucify Me’ and ‘Relapse’ released over the past year, ‘Chaos Theory’ presents the latest glimpse into what is undoubtedly one of bass culture’s most eagerly anticipated debut longplayers.

Already a huge star in Australia – where he is without doubt the biggest homegrown DnB star since Pendulum, enjoying headline billing at festivals such Big Day Out and guaranteed daytime playlisting on Triple J radio – ShockOne’s fame has spread worldwide as his long standing relationship with Viper, alongside remixes for artist such as Netsky, Brookes Brothers and Stanton Warriors have seen him grow into one of the most sought after DJ’s, remixers and producers in bass culture. ‘Chaos Theory’ is the latest in a long line of bass wielding super dubs which give a representation of ShockOne as an artist and as a DJ… huge bass, impeccable production with sonic subtlety and melodic nuance.",30665,71,http://www.facebook.com/shockonemusic,http://www.facebook.com/shockonemusic,https://twitter.com/therealshockone,,"http://shockone.com.au

When he isn't saving lives, he can be found practicing his passion in clubs around the country, his wonderful technique of mixing songs together sets him apart from the other DJs, who also mix songs together.

It's been a busy 12 months for Tropical/Future Bass producer Champagne Drip. He followed up his Winter 2014 EP, ""Radio Bikini"", with official remixes for Bassnectar and indie-electronic band Lemonade. In May he released a Remix EP, which featured friends Big Wild, Lazerdisk, Mayhem, and Son of Kick, each taking their turn at remixing his debut.  In August he released a new mixtape presented by Australian-based dance blog Stoney Roads, which featured all 6 tracks from ""Journey Into the Champange Sea""; a brand new EP released in September on Mad Decent. He quickly followed up the EP with an exclusive mix for Insomniac entitled ""Treasure Trove"" as well as brand new single ""Moonlight"".

In 2016, Champagne Drip will be taking to the road to support new remixes for Grandtheft and Cardinox, a collab single with Brillz, and his 3rd EP.",9808,58,http://www.facebook.com/champagnedrip,http://www.facebook.com/champagnedrip,http://twitter.com/champagnedrip,,,11,"bojan@rogueagency.us,gregg@rogueagency.uscolin@mavenartists.com"

DJ SOO steadfastly (some say stubbornly) refuses to be pigeonholed in any specific genre or style. Long considered one of Vancouver’s best party-rocking DJs, SOO has spent the last decade perfecting his craft and honing his skills – mixing, cutting, scratching and blending a wide range of different styles while keeping heads nodding and bodies moving.
Having supported a virtual who’s who list of talent (including such diverse artists as Q-Bert, Z-Trip, Mix Master Mike, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Numark, Lorin Bassnectar, the Stanton Warriors, Shy FX, and many more), been involved in countless residencies, and having played in venues around the world, SOO has garnered an international reputation as being one of Canada’s most diverse, skilled, and original DJs. Equally at home in front of a packed dancefloor as he is an intimate lounge, SOO is known as much for his unique musical selection as the intricate manner in which he weaves the music together. This skill and technique lead to DJ SOO winning the 2009 Vancouver Megablend DJ competition – a contest that featured over 40 local Djs.
￼
￼These days, DJ SOO is keeping himself busy: playing a wide assortment of gigs, touring, creating a steady flow of acclaimed mixtapes, throwing parties with the Super Happy Dance Deejay crew, or performing one of his legendary 4- turntable sets with longtime collaborator DJ Wood. In addition, SOO has been sequestering himself in the studio to create more original productions and remixes – many of which have been receiving support from DJs around the world. 2011 has been a big year for SOO with 4 tracks signed and 2012 looks to be even bigger. Merely 2 months into the year, DJ SOO has already had two chart topping releases hit #1! His first vinyl release - a devastating bass-heavy re-imagining of the classic Grandmaster Flash track The Message hit #1 on the Juno Breakbeat/Electro vinyl charts within days. His first collaboration with DJ WOOD released on the Tremendo Records Vol 2 EP helped propel the EP to #1 in the overall sales Charts on Juno Download within a week.
Never content to simply follow trends of the day, SOO thrives on broadening his own musical horizons in an endless search for new music and styles to keep even the most jaded of partiers firmly entrenched on the dance-floor. SOO brings with him a palate of music that covers a wide spectrum of styles – forward-thinking underground sounds, familiar classics, soulful rare groove, banging club hits, and much more – all mixed seamlessly to perfection with a healthy dose of turntablism added for good measure. Whether at a club, lounge, rave, or house party, having SOO behind the decks is a guarantee for a rump-shaking good time.",6885,38,http://www.facebook.com/djsoo,http://www.facebook.com/djsoo,http://twitter.com/dj_soo,,"http://djsoo.woodnsoo.com

RUN DMT’s sound reflects a torrid love affair with heavy basslines, thunderous beats, and haunting melodies. Formed in Austin, TX in the summer of 2010, RUN DMT approached heavy bass music without borders; touching on Dubstep, Drumstep, Trap, Moombahton, atmospheric Downtempo and more. In his short 2.5 year of history he has made high profile appearances at Electric Daisy Carnival, Coachella, The Vans Warped Tour, Camp Bisco, Nocturnal Festival, Wakarusa, Snowball Music Festival, and Counterpoint Fest . His original productions and remixes have become recent playlist staples for DJs ranging from Bassnectar to Flux Pavilion to Excision to 12th Planet and beyond. RUN DMT has also done official remixes for the likes of The Who (yes THE WHO), Major Lazer, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Fitz & The Tantrums, Figure, and Hundred Waters.

In 2011, RUN DMT’s first official release, “Drop Top” hit the top of the Beatport charts and remained in the Top 10 for six weeks. “Drop Top” was followed by a series of high charting EPs and a high profile inclusion on the Mortal Kombat video game soundtrack with “Baraka’s Theme”. RUN DMT capped off the year with a Mad Decent-released mixtape “Year of White Rabbit”.

In June 2012, RUN DMT released his debut full length album “Union of Opposites”, featuring Chali 2na, Dj Swamp, and Zeale, which hit #2 Dubstep and #11 Variety Charts on Beatport. RUN DMT closed out 2012 with a brand new 58-track, 140 minute mixtape, “The Existential Mix”.

In 2013 Run DMT’s official remix of Major Lazer’s “Jah No Partial” was released thru Mad Decent/Downtown. 2013 also saw the release of his remix for Dimitri Vegas/Like Mike/Lil Jon’s “Madness” on Dim Mak Records. A new Self-Titled 8-Track EP dropped in July 2013 to press acclaim from Vice, Rolling Stone, Magnectic Magazine, Thissongissick, and many other crucial tastemakers. 

2014 saw the release of RUN DMT's remix of Diplo's ""Revolution"" on Mad Decent Records, which ended up being featured on the commercial for the video game, Titanfall. Also released was the RUN DMT remix of Twenty-One Pilot's ""Car Radio"" on Fueled by Ramen. 
October saw the release of RUN DMTs remix of the godfather of bass Bassnectar's ""Now"" featured on the NVSB remix album. Late 2014 RUN DMT is co,pleteing his 3rd studio album",28924,46,http://www.facebook.com/pages/RUN-DMT/135418326502793?v=app_2405167945&ref=ts,http://www.facebook.com/pages/RUN-DMT/135418326502793?v=app_2405167945&ref=ts,http://www.twitter.com/therundmt,http://www.youtube.com/rundmtvisionscreen,,6,john@killyouregonow.com

Merging modern bass music with the retro sounds of jazz, blues, disco and funk, Defunk has taken bass music to new heights. From up-tempo to downright dirty, he blends the old with the new across countless genres and tempos. From swinging saxophone solos, to banjo breakdowns, soul-sister vocal build ups and face melting bass drops. He aims to create electronic music that knows no bounds or overdone sounds. He intends to take music with soul and recreate it, bringing back music from the decades, filtering it, and blasting it back in your face. Its music that is as relevant to the bass scene as it is fresh at the same time.

At the prime age of 21, Fresh Kiwi is fast becoming an important & recognisable name in Australasia's dance music scene. Hailing from the vibey kiwi capital Wellington, it was only a matter of time before he ventured out into nightlife venues & dance fanatic areas across Australasia. His bouncy, bass driven remixes of commercial/top 40 hits and high energy party sets have helped shape a strong following and fanbase across the world, picking up support from big international acts (Sigala, Timmy Trumpet, Juicy M & Some Blonde to name a few) and gaining radio play on numerous dance music stations (BPM Radio & Fox FM AUS, NRJ France & ZM MOS Sessions NZ) 

With a constant and increased demand for catchy commercial bounce music, it is his unique remixes & ever-growing discography that has pushed the Fresh Kiwi name across numerous continents. Fresh kiwi’s musical background has helped him develop a melody driven, fun & catchy style with incorporated rap and trap elements. 2015 has seen fresh kiwi gain just under 20,000 Soundcloud followers across his 3 accounts (Main, Remix & Exclusives Accounts) while registering 2 Million total plays & 8,000 new Facebook fans all coming from across the globe (with Australia, New Zealand, UK & USA taking out the top 4)

Currently unsigned and looking to make his breakthrough in the music industry one day.

In 2007.... Mark started to remix songs using a piece of software called ""Sony Acid Pro"" but as that didn't get very far, Mark had to move on to bigger and better things so in 2008 he discovered a Swedish DJ under the name of ""Basshunter"", Mark started to take inspiration and stumbled across a ""Youtube"" video of ""Basshunter"" himself creating music on the spot using a piece of software called ""Fruity Loops""... Thats when Mark became ""Marky S"" and in 2009 released his first ever song ""Techno Nation"". Many remixes were released in 2009, 2010 & 2011 and Marky S will have more coming up soon.
And in the near distant future Marky S might just be playing his songs near you :)

2012 has seen many remixes and hopefully many more to come in the future so stay tuned.

Inspirations have come from many artists such as Basshunter, Justin Corza, Afrojack, Skrillex, Promised Land, Deadmau5, Nicky Romero Etc.

Subz then knew how use them harder programmes such as Cubase Sx3 and Logic Pro 9 and started to create music on them, the only problem was which genre of music is he going to stick to and limit himself to only 7 genres (Rnb, HipHop, Dub, 2-Step Dnb, Dubstep and Drumstep) till from this date Subz has found his unique sound and fully concentrated on Dubstep as a main genre.

Games Continued by Bakermat & Goldfish http://smarturl.it/gamescontinueddirty
Heart Shaped Box OUT NOW http://smarturl.it/goldfishhsb


The secret is officially out. An electronic duo from the Southern-most tip of Africa have gone from one of Dance Music’s best kept secrets to an act tipped by industry tastemakers as the band to watch this year.
Their genre-defying mix of live instruments, House beats and searing live performances has seen Goldfish go from impromtu jams at a tiny beach club in Cape Town to headlining Amsterdam’s Olympic Stadium, cracking a top 10 on the US iTunes Dance chart, a residency at Pacha Ibiza with David Guetta and DJ’s like Fedde le Grand knocking at their door to do remix their tracks. It’s almost hard to believe that not very long ago they were just Dom and Dave, two music students who lived a relatively chilled life of surfing and playing music in their home town Cape Town.

All that really did change when they decided to record an album. Not having a record deal or much money, they simply locked themselves in a bedroom...with a double bass, a saxophone and a couple of synths, recording their debut Caught In The Loop on their own. A charming dance record that received massive support from the international dance music scene, desperate for something fresh and new. Pete Tong even called it his Ibiza Poolside Album of the Summer.

The two guys quickly found themselves maintaining gruelling international tour schedule that saw them play sold-out shows from Amsterdam to Miami, from the Sydney Opera House to Sao Paulo, in-between still finding time to mix the covermount CD for DJ mag international, garnering a record-breaking 8 SAMA nominations, numerous number ones radio at home, as well as performances at Glastonbury, Sensation White, Ultra Festival Miami, 46664 and Get Loaded in the Park amongst others.

They even got their hands on a residency to die for; Friday night at Ibiza super-club Pacha. Here they developed their sound further and presented it on their second album Perceptions of Pacha. As no other album, Perceptions Of Pacha captures the carefree vibe of the magical island of Ibiza, with their track Fort Knox cracking the Top 10 on the US iTunes Dance Charts. Following that up with the SAMA award-winning album Get Busy Living featuring the smash Youtube hit video We come together that garnered millions of online views for it’s hilarious and ground breaking animation work that has become a Goldfish trademark.

With props coming from everyone from Dr Dre, Sebastian Ingrosso, Pete Tong, Sander Kleinenberg, Fedde Le Grand and Faithless, watch this space. The Re-invention of the DJ has arrived.

The BloodThinnerz, comprised of Kevin Aeroblood and Ernest Manimosity, are a blood thirsty DJ/production duo born and raised in Los Angeles, California.  These two bloody savages have been producing their sound since 2011 utilizing their past musical background in Metal in which they were both guitarists, which indubitably caused a very natural transition into their grasp of and creation of the aggressive, savage sound they are currently producing. Together, two is greater than one, so we can only imagine that the dynamic duo with their production skills and creative minds consist of an end result of bloody, savage, hard hitting basslines that will make any crowd go wild.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Label Manager | A&amp;R | COMPORT
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Dansor, real name Anett Kulcsar, is fast cementing herself as one of Holland’s hotly tipped electronic music artists. Founder of Comport Records, the Hungarian-born producer has released on the likes of Tulipa and Nervous, and is also the former winner of Pete Tong’s Bedroom Bedlam and Dave Clarke’s ADE Demlotion panel. An established live act as well as a DJ, Dansor’s performances have graced Sziget Festival, Ozora Festival and Hungarian Summer tour Balaton Sound, not to mention an inventive appearance at ADE where she performed her forthcoming album ‘Theory Of Love’ live alongside jazz musicians.
 
Born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, Anett Kulcsar grew up listening to Duran Duran, Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk before moving to the Netherlands in 1997 - a switch that would play a significant role in intensifying her relationship with all things house and techno. Throwing herself into the scene, she found home in the work of electronic acts such as Art Of Noise, Leftfield, Front 242 and clubs such as “Feketelyuk” (Black Hole) and “Zöldség-Gyümölcs” (Fruits and Vegetables), not to mention the acid house parties that sprung up during the time.
 
Acquiring a taste for illegal raves in her home of Budapest, she later left due to the country’s economic situation to make her way to the Netherlands in search of a new lease of life. It was here where she acquired her first set of decks and also made friends with Dutch producer Georgio Schultz who pushed her towards installing Cubase on her Atari computer. Anett Kulcsar would later establish her ‘WomenWaves’ parties in her adopted town of Haarlem, followed by ‘Budapest Delight’ events in Amsterdam together with Szilvia Harsz.
 
Soon after the Dansor project was born during the final semester of her Media Technology studies in the ‘00s. A live act that could be controlled without the need to stand behind a laptop, it didn’t immediately set pulses racing - with even the lady herself admitting that it was way ahead of its time. What it did prove beyond any doubt, however, is that Dansor is a producer not intent on taking the traditional route.
 
Such avant-garde approaches course throughout her productions too. Unsurprisingly, then, they’ve been picked up by a host of seminal worldly imprints including Little Mountain, This Is Recordings, Nervous Records and Tulipa. This is replicated in similar vogue via her Comport Records, which she helms alongside Soundbalance and Von Smir, that also plays host to her intricate sound by incorporating elements from house to techno to dub, jazz/funk, italo disco, new wave and indie.
 
Ahead of her debut album ‘Theory Of Love’, Dansor has released a selection of singles from the long player, including remixes from Jiggler, Animal Picnic, Thomas Gandey, Zoe Xenia, Sezer Uysal and Just Her. These have garnered support from the likes of DJ Mag, Complex, Electronic Groove, Ibiza Voice,When We Dip and her remix of Digitaria's  ‘Useless Fantasies’ even picked up support from Rolling Stone. 
 
Dropping her debut album at the start of 2016, ‘Theory of Love’ garnered a glowing print review in DJ Mag, radio support from the likes of BBC Radio 6 Music’s Nemone, John Digweed and Jonty Skrufff, not to mention topping the Beatport charts with the release hitting no.1 in Breaks, no.14 Electronica, no.18 Deep House, no.23 in the Tech House - resulting in an overall Top 100 appearance at no.93. Now, with her live set evolving and Comport Records maturing, 2016 looks to be the most propitious year yet for this bright and promising individual.",7630,71,https://www.facebook.com/dansormusic,https://www.facebook.com/dansormusic,https://twitter.com/dansormusic,https://www.youtube.com/user/dansortv,"http://www.dansor.net

Electro Hip-Hop Soul moniker Krooked Drivers has been captivating ears ever since the launch of his musical vision in 2011. The mind behind KD is Donnie Dalbora who is based out of Denver Colorado. Krooked Drivers is keeping the sounds of the past alive by sampling vinyl records from past eras of time collaging breaks and organic elements creating an entirely new feeling and direction. Blending heavy hitting bass lines with neck breaking drum patterns and endless sample chops rest assured KD will take you on an emotion driven musical roller coaster ride that will leave you begging for more.

James Smith, also known as FreeFall, is an on-the-rise producer known for creating a bass-heavy sound we want to hear more of. From San Francisco, FreeFall has been “killing the bass game with his pounding rhythms and heavy melodies,” Techibeats recently raved of the young artist.

With musical influences constantly changing, FreeFall is always looking to his friends and the people he shares his music with for inspiration for new tracks. This is not just limited to electronic music – throw in some metal, reggae, you name it – ideas are bounced off each other and creations are made. FreeFall‘s top tracks are “Choppers” and “Pressure”, and has worked with the Audiophile Live, Audiophile XXL and Svb Rosa labels.

The talented young artist has a continuing list of accolades and praise from YourEDM, EDM Sauce, Techibeats and more – FreeFall knows how to perfectly construct evil beats that are sure to satisfy the most bloodthirsty bass fanatics. He has shared the stage with the Circus Records boys – Flux Pavilion, Cookie Monsta & Doctor P – among many others including ETC ETC, Kill The Noise, Borgore and Dillon Francis.

In the next few months, FreeFall plans to continue working on productions and collaborations with Aaron Jackson, Jameston Thieves, our own M3RC and more, on top of releasing some individual work. Throw in some traveling, and there’s no stopping FreeFall in what he has to bring to the table in the bass music genre.

Scotland’s bad-boy AV funkers Shaka Loves You boast a full audio-visual show with live percussion. Effortlessly fusing elements of funk, soul, disco & hip-hop with custom visuals and turntablism, SLY create the perfect, good times live show.

Since forming in 2012 Jamie & Marty have already shared the stage with heavyweights such as Chali 2na of Jurassic 5, DJ Yoda, Mr Scruff, James Lavelle, A.Skillz & The Funk Hunters and have an impressive number of gigs and performances behind them.

As well as their weekly residency at Glasgow's home of funk & soul; The Buff Club, the boys have played clubs from Edinburgh to Amsterdam as well as festival appearances up and down the UK including T in the Park, Beat Herder and Eden. Add to this a Canadian mini-tour in the Summer of 2015 and you get a picture of how the boys are spreading their funky sound far & wide.

Complementing their live show, SLY are regularly releasing their own music and videos. 2016 has got off to a flying start with Craig Charles picking up the boys' forthcoming track Soul On Fire on his 'What's big in 2016' show on BBC 6 Music. This track also attracted the attention of Mixmag, which gave it an 8/10 review. Their first EP, released in 2013 hit the top spot on Juno download and their second, a heavily disco influenced affair, has been snapped up by the legendary Goodgroove Records and is set be released February 2016. 

With a busy gigging and production schedule ahead 2016 is set to be another big year for Shaka Loves You.

We’re an international artist duo who produce and play house music. Our signature sound has been described once as “music that makes your girlfriend wanna dance”, but of course as an artist you’re always trying to take things to the next level – “music that makes your entire family including even your goldfish wanna dance”. We were born in the 80’s, so musically speaking, we’re kids of the 90’s – you may be able to hear some of that in our sounds as well. For over 10 years, we’ve been doing music together, on the side, and that is pretty much still the case. That is why we’ve learnt to value musical substance over form and take most of the secondary issues of the music game with a grain of salt (for instance, whether you really need a quasi-3rd person bio). Recently, Redondo singles “Love Too Deep” and “Tattoo Girl” and other works on labels like Spinnin’ Records, Toolroom and Material have gotten us in an all new spotlight. Meanwhile we just keep on doing what we like, trying to contribute something by enjoying ourselves and enjoying others – that’s what makes it worth our while. Nothing more and nothing less. We are originally from Amsterdam, Netherlands, and we run our label Witty Tunes out of Washington, DC together with our brothers Sideburn. Google us, and you’ll find out how to connect to us through the social networks.",21963,60,http://www.facebook.com/redondomusicnl,http://www.facebook.com/redondomusicnl,http://twitter.com/RedondoMusicNL,https://www.youtube.com/user/RedondoMusicNL,"http://www.redondomusic.nl

ZYDEN,Chill/Mainstream,Jarrod Mcclintock,http://soundcloud.com/zydenmusic,Jarrad@candys.com,"For bookings - Email - Jarrad@candys.com.au

Not being pigeonholed to one single genre Zyden is a breath of fresh air either behind the decks smashing out massive sets or in the studio creating all kinds of dance floor destroyers, already gaining support from Aus djs such as Glover, Dimatik, G-Wizard, Dj Minx and many more along with international heavyweight Hirshee. First Inspired by the sound of Axwell, Steve Angello and basically the Whole Swedish house/Groove sound, but also producers like Tommy Trash and Showtek. While this new kid on the block is Only relatively new to producing starting out firstly Djing, his passion for all things big and uplifting have been strong for many years, but it was upon Meeting his biggest Idols Swedish House Mafia at there Australian One Last tour that that sparked something in him and he knew there was no more time to waste, He then went and Purchased Home studio Equipment the very next week And Zyden was born. 
Having supported most of Australias biggest industry Heavyweights, national and international Dj/producers such as The Aston Shuffle, Stafford Brothers, Helena, Ajax, Joel Fletcher, Scndl ,J-Trick, Tigerlily, Zoolanda, Slice n Dice, Kyro, Ember, Mashd n Kutcher, Samual James, JDG, Zac Waters, Holly-J, Matt Watkins, A-Tonez, Some Blonde Dj And many more the list goes on! Along with playing at Music Festivals and holding a residency at one of Australias best Nightclubs theres certainly no slowing down for Zyden in fact this is just the beginning! Having two tracks - Freedom and -The bounce, go up on beatport earlier this year, included on a compilation album which is sold globally and an enormous passion for Dance music that stems back to his childhood music is more than just a hobby for this guy. Eat sleep and breathe music is the way of life for Zyden. expect big things to come as he is just getting started. Whether its behind the decks controlling a crowd or in his productions theres something special about this Kids approach which is fresh yet bigroom style inspired.

Don't try to classify partymaster Willy Joy as anything but that - a party. He and his productions have been packing sweaty dancefloors across the country from major festivals to sweaty underground raves. His songs have been remixed by some of today's top producers such as Dillon Francis & Flosstradamus while tearing up clubs across the country. Willy's tunes get played by the likes of Diplo, Adventure Club, Brillz & BBC Radio 1. Willy represents the eclectic new breed of bass music, rapidly changing styles and tempos with ease while always maintaining a frenzied, hands-in-the-air dancefloor.

While creating official remixes for Major Lazer, Flosstradamus, A-Trak and original releases on Fools Gold and Firepower Records, Willy also co-produced ""Mash Up The Dance"" with Major Lazer for their album ""Free The Universe"". He collaborated with Brillz for the standout track ""WTF"" on the TWONK EP, and many more collaborations are in the works. He is currently prepping a slew of new music for release later this year. 

With constant touring throughout North America and beyond, Willy is set to blow up fast. Come see him live and you'll instantly know why. Willy is known for blending disparate sounds into a single, ecstatic, live moment.",36586,37,http://facebook.com/willyjoy,http://facebook.com/willyjoy,,,,14,mike@circletalentagency.comcon@rad.biz

Hailing from the Netherlands, Bart van der Meer - known as Bart B More - has been a constant factor in the international electronic dance music scene for many years. His love for DJing and producing has taken him to every continent on the planet, leaving his audience with something to remember - or not to remember. 

Bart B More's genre-bending style has helped him to become one of the most renown and respected electronic music producers today. He steers away from a traditional production formula to help create his own signature sound: A fusion of deep techno and heart-pumping electro, with an unusual swing in the drum patterns. His eclectic mix of synths, unparalleled sonic range, hard-hitting drops, and heavy bass lines have helped him to create a distinct and original style. The ability to make each beat, synth, and drop flow seamlessly together in his sets, has made Bart a well seen guest at events all over the globe.

Bart does not discriminate against mainstream and underground music, and prefers to draw inspiration from anywhere and everywhere; ""The limitations and borders a genre can imply sometimes kills creativity in the producing process, and that's something artists deal with. I try to stay away from that mind frame, and just create how I feel."" His non-commitment to any specific genre and ever-changing tastes make each one of his shows a whole new, fresh experience: ""Every set to me is a challenge to entertain a crowd, to bring forward my musical taste but also read the crowds mood. And if that's the same thing, that's when I love what I do the most.""

In 2008, Bart found a new challenge and created his own label, Secure Recordings. Since then, the label has been an outlet for Bart to release his own music as well as share his various tastes and musical range. By starting his own label, he's able to showcase not only his own style, but also give new artists a platform to release their music. Bart is a firm believer in supporting new and up and coming artists, and by establishing Secure Recordings he's able to give them a chance to make their mark in the industry. 

In addition to his own label, Bart has had the opportunity to release many of his tracks with some of the industry's top labels including: Boys Noize, OWSLA, Relief Records, Sound Pellegrino, Fool's Gold, Trouble & Bass etc. By releasing with different labels he has been able to reach an even larger and more diverse demographic, putting him into the spotlight of many devout electronic dance music fans. 

In the future, Bart B More hopes to continue to have a role in the responsibility to keep dance music forward thinking, innovative, and open minded.

Fred McLovin,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/fred-mclovin,promos@fredmclovin.com,"Rising above the masses of electronic music producers, Fred McLovin has quickly become a force to be reckoned with in the realms of hard, bouncy and aggressive electronic dance music. With a consistent flow of quality tunes, methodic dj sets and a charismatic stage presence, Fred is definitely cementing himself as a major player. Don’t take our word for it though, with support from superstars like Hardwell, Showtek, Fedde Le Grand, Dannic, Steve Aoki, Chuckie, Danny Avila, Marcel Woods, Jordy Dazz, Joachim Garraud, Justin Prime, Joe Ghost, J-Trick, Juicy M and many more, it’s pretty clear that Fred has got the skills. 

Determined to leave his imprint on the EDM scene, Fred has already played most of the premier venues in eastern Canada. He also shared the stage with a plethora of major DJs, traveling week in and week out around the country. Even with a busy schedule, fred has found the time to craft his sound and get recognition from labels such as Dim Mak, Club Cartel and Peakhour Music. He also had his fair share of success in the Beatport charts, his best one being with “The Art Of War” at #41. 

With all these feats and rise through the ranks, it’s obvious that Fred is one of the most promising canadian producers. Countless hours in the studio has made him a production genius and the best part about his story is that it’s only the beginning…

=========================
Having both started their musical careers at the young age of 17, Split & Jaxta each bring different backgrounds and styles to their effort which blends exceptionally into a unique and formidable sound. Stylistically, their music derives influences from the psy-trance genre that seems to be the leading sound for Israel’s EDM culture, and twists into an electro-based spectrum, with distorted synths and a certain rock and roll rawness.

Split got his start as a electro/hard house DJ in the UK, making his rounds in Europe and even to DJ competitions in Ibiza. Jaxta was headed along a more rock & roll route, having been a guitarist with metal and rock influences. 

In the fateful year of 2009, the duo met in their hometown of Tel Aviv’s largest music school, “Muzik.” They quickly decided to pair up, and a year later released their first ep on Plasmapool’s sublabel NOIZE. This boosted the duo to create more, and with that came remixes for the likes of Hedflux, Audiophonic, 4I20, Alex Mind, E-Cologyk, Cool Project, Fractal System, Keemereh and more.

Since 2012 Split & Jaxta have been performing around the globe in countries including Israel, Sweden, USA, Mexico, Switzerland and Australia. With massive following every step of the way they hope to conquer a few more destinations this year.",7205,29,http://www.facebook.com/Split.Jaxta,http://www.facebook.com/Split.Jaxta,http://www.twitter.com/splitnjaxta,http://youtube.com/user/splitnjaxta,"http://madabeats.com

After much success with his previous moniker, Stupid Fresh, producer Chris Elliot started his his solo project ""Nom De Strip"" in 2009. Chris has since gone on to release many underground hits, and more recently has put out two acclaimed EP's - Clouds EP Vol 1 and Vol 2 - as well as an official remix of Tommy Trash’s ‘Monkey See Monkey Do’. All these tracks finding their natural home on deadmau5's highly successful mau5trap label imprint.

Nom has been hailed as one to watch by industry heavyweights such as deadmau5, Tiesto, Swedish House Mafia, Wolfgang Gartner, Tommy Trash, Dada Life and Dirty South. The producer was greeted with massive support from deadmau5 in 2012, leading to a string of remixes under the mau5trap label. Recent key tracks include ‘The Nothing’, 'Swagnum P.I.', and a remix of mau5's ‘Channel 42', both tracks having a meteoric impact online.

In 2013, he signed an exclusive deal with Chris Lake’s Rising Music label. With his forthcoming and eagerly anticipated collaboration with Hatiras called “Nippleodeon” as well as collabs with Chris Lake, TJR, and Nezzo to name a few, Nom De Strip is no doubt one to watch.",48121,59,http://www.facebook.com/nomdestrip,http://www.facebook.com/nomdestrip,https://twitter.com/NomDeStrip,,,1,david@circletalentagency.compaul@primarytalent.commalea@theneuegroup.com

Fabio Bacchini,Creative,,http://soundcloud.com/fabiobacchini,fabiobacchini@gmail.com,"Fabio Bacchini is one of those people who lives and breathes music. 

He began composing his own music at the incredible age of five using the now famous Atari ST 1204 allied to Cubase and Encore. It wasn't long before his passion for creating music led him to learn the piano as well as percussion and electric bass. While he draws inspiration from a wide variety of music, disco, jazz, funk, soul and house in particular hold a special place in his heart. A keen collector of rare vintage records from the 70s and 80s, anyone who has ever seen his collection can have little doubt about his love for the music of those eras. 

Fabio's production career has seen him release original productions and remixes on labels all over the world. Indeed by the time he launched Mindtravel Recordings, in 2008 his material had already featured on no fewer than twenty five labels. Fabio's collaborations include projects with some of the most respected artists in the business including Michael Procter, Charles Dockins and Wendy Lewis to name just a few.

In 2011 he released a track called ""Funk Is The Message"" on Defected records featured on a compilation mixed by DJ Meme and Sandy Rivera

In 2012 and 2013 Fabio have been working on two side projects in a electro & turbofunk mood called “Speaker Buster” and “Surfdisco” producing records on some of the most important labels like Wearhouse Music and Simma Records as well as sharing the desks with big artists like Cassius, Crookers, Jack Beats, Le Castle Vania, Reset!, Tom Staar, Botnek and DJ Falcon.

2014 is the year of the huge come back of Fabio Bacchini in the deep & tech house scene with new exciting releases on labels like the famous Chicago based label Moody Recordings and italians Hotfingers and Lapsus Music confirming once again his key role in the house music world scene.

AlphaBit was started one fateful night in San Luis Obispo, CA while friends Carl Saputo and Tim Byrne had a little too much fun sailing along with Captain Morgan and decided it was time to take on the dubstep community one ptot at a time. After working together for a month or so they were booked for their gig in San Francisco, so they called up MC and long time friend Chris Catalano to add some flavor to their set. The set went so well Tim and Carl decided to bring Chris on as a permanent part of AlphaBit. The trio has been spotted all over the bay area tearing up dance floors wherever they may be.",7025,89,http://www.facebook.com/AlphaBitOfficial,http://www.facebook.com/AlphaBitOfficial,https://twitter.com/AlphaBitDubstep,,,2,alphabitdubstep@gmail.com

Promos: chuckdarker@gmail.com



The rise of Charlie Darker has been anything but ordinary. Tapped by some of the biggest names in dance music before he was even old enough to have a drink, the Canadian­-born phenom has been producing some of the most forward­thinking and hardest-­hitting Electro of the last few years. 

Strongly influenced by the first wave of the mid-­late 2000s, it was acts like Justice, The Bloody Beetroots, MSTRKRFT, SebastiAn and more who ignited a desire to bring pure raw energy to the dance floor.

With mentors like Wolfgang Gartner and JFK from MSTRKRFT, he quickly crafted a one­-of-­a-­kind approach driven by cutting-­edge sound design leading to releases on Dim Mak, Kindergarten Records, Mad Decent and more. In 2013, at just 21 years-­old, Charlie Darker was invited by Tommy Trash and “Uncle Wolf”, as he calls his esteemed advisor, on their national Hounds of Hell tour playing to massive crowds at some of the most iconic venues in North America including Webster Hall, the Hollywood Palladium and Washington DC’s Echostage.

Moving forward to 2015, Charlie Darker has racked up impressive support from some of the top names in dance music including Tiesto, Zedd, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, David Guetta, Chuckie, Porter Robinson, Zeds Dead and countless others. He’s remixed the likes of Diplo, Wolfgang Gartner, Zedd, Felix Cartal & Autoérotique to great acclaim.

The past few months have seen him invited by Zedd to remix the mega hit“Beautiful Now” and release an explosive anthem called “D2B” on Dim Mak. With an ambitious EP ready to unleash on Big Beat later this year, there’s no telling what the future holds for this rising star.",26879,265,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Charlie-Darker/142490755787656,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Charlie-Darker/142490755787656,http://twitter.com/#!/ischarliedarker,,,11,amar@emvtalents.comchuckdarker@gmail.com

Aria Award winning producer M-Phazes is the personified example of a diamond in the rough. Born and raised in the Gold Coast of Australia, isolated from the music industry, M-Phazes spent hours in his bedroom meticulously perfecting his sound while working with artists via the internet. Earning his stripes with his unique brand of sample based Hip-Hop, M-Phazes quickly became known for his soulful & melodic take on Hip-Hop production.  Now working from his Melbourne studio, M-Phazes’ new sound transcends Hip-Hop, drawing inspiration from all genres and has since made him a “go-to producer” as opposed to the “go-to Hip-Hop producer “.

To date, M-Phazes has compiled an outstanding discography that includes placements with a vast array of international artists including Eminem, Amerie, Xzibit & Talib Kweli. His hometown pedigree is second to none having co-produced Grammy Award winner Kimbra’s debut breakthrough album Vows and worked with a wide variety of Australian artists such as Bliss N Eso, Eskimo Joe, 360 and most recently M-Phazes has executive produced Illy’s 4th studio album “Cinematic”.  

""I work with M-phazes on alot of music and it still amazes me how great his drums sound sonically!  Incredible!""  - Grammy Award Winning Producer S1

Landing his first U.S. placement in 2005 on Supastition’s “Chain Letters”, M-Phazes has been on a steady climb and hasn't looked back. In March of 2008, M-Phazes earned himself a first place victory at Sha Money's prestigious One Stop Shop Producers Conference Beat Battle, an event that's held annually in Phoenix, Arizona. M-Phazes' production was judged by a panel of eminent producers such as DJ Premier (Nas, Gangstarr, Christina Aguilera), Swizz Beats (Jay Z, Kayne West), Sha Money and Denaun Porter (Eminem) to name a few. 

Since moving to Melbourne in 2008, M-Phazes has appeared simply unstoppable. Aside from landing production credits on almost every major Hip-Hop release in Australia, M-Phazes released his debut album “Good Gracious” in April 2010 through Obese Records that would later earn him the coveted 2010 Aria Award for Best Urban Release. Foreseeably, this was only the beginning for the Gold Coast beat-smith.
Outside of his production work, M-Phazes performs the occasional solo DJ set, having toured South Africa, Europe and Australia supporting artists such as Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne  & Wu Tang Clan.

M-Phazes is living proof that no matter where you're from, your music can make an impact on the rest of the world. M-Phazes places no boundaries on his craft that continues to see him working alongside artists that define today’s music culture.",26478,175,http://www.facebook.com/mphazes,http://www.facebook.com/mphazes,http://www.twitter.com/mphazes,http://www.youtube.com/mphazestv,,1,nate@flagrantartists.competrina@xposedmedia.com

___
2015 marks a new departure for one of Scotland’s most loved artists Jack Eye Jones. Following a number of eminently successful years producing mashups and edits with the support of everyone from Avicii to EDX as well as having his own tracks remixed by the likes of Tiësto and Laidback Luke, it’s now time for Jack to put his own original music to the forefront. Firmly ensconced in his new LA based studio the Scot has steadily been constructing a series of dancefloor focused anthems.
 
His 2015 offering will come in the form of a first ever artist album entitled 'Summer Nights' to be released this October on IBZ Records. A collection of futuristic anthems incorporating influences from a plethora of sources including classic vocal house and tropical house, the new album will be a showcase of everything that fans have come to expect from this dynamic producer. With a number of special vocalists including Hana, Sirene and Scottish star Nicky McDonald, Jack Eye Jones has brought together a formidable lineup of artists to compliment his energetic creations.
 
There’s something special brewing deep in the hills of Los Angeles, and it’s time for the world to hear it.

Tommy Vercetti _ House , Disco & Techno Lover.
Definition 
Love Not  Money Records.
Eton Messy

Introducing Tom Cox, the 21 year old DJ and music producer from the West Midlands, otherwise known as Tommy Vercetti. Having had the pleasure of playing all around the UK and with regular overseas bookings in Europe, 2015 has been an exciting year for Tommy.

With Radio 1 support, numerous remix requests and tipped as one of Eton Messy’s ‘Top 5 to watch’, it’s no wonder Tommy’s recent release on Love Not Money Records has gained support  from artists including Tensnake, Josh Butler, Claude VonStroke, Route 94 and Shapeshifters. 

Growing up, Garage was the prominent sound for Tommy and his music today bears strong influences from that era. Music runs in the family; with his dad being a DJ, Tommy has grown up listening to quality House, Disco & Soul music, and has been DJing and making music since his early teen years. With such strong influences, non-stop bookings and a growing number of releases gaining support from all the right people, Tommy is certainly one to watch out for.

------------

The French electronic music dj/producer Elomak is at the forefront of Paris house music industry for the past few years. Highly influenced by mid 90s artists and 80s electrofunk stuff, he released many remixes and EPs on international growing labels like Code 2 Records, Formule, Seek, Leonizer Records, Boxon Records or Ters Music.

Elomak signed his first ep ""Circular EP"" on Formule Records featuring a remix by Tail Spin duet. Then he made a rework of Adam Polo's ""Cotton Candy"" which has been released on the maxi of the same name and without a break composed his second single ""Insert Coins EP"". He worked with international producers like Modfunk (Seek Records flagship band who successfully completed a project with Zdar, one-half of Cassius), The Edge and Love Meets Lust for several remixes. His EP ""Astroboy EP"", which features a remix from the talented producer Michell Phunk, has also been released on Formule Records along with his famous single ""Spacecraft"" whose eponymous main track became one of the Techno Parade (French major electronic music event) anthems. His epic ""Biometric"" track has also been included in the compilation ""BOXON Makes Me Crazy"" on BOXON Records, out in digital and vinyl.  Early after another remix for famous French artist Sovnger, he joined the French team Folistar and released his highly explosive “Crackle EP” and at the same time begin to cook several heavy house tinted remix for artists like Bernard Blade, LGML, Prosper or Adam Polo on Code 2 Records and Leonizer Records. His last releases on Ters Music anchored its new musical insight, deeper and more old school filled, like his remix for Bernard Blade “You Broke My Heart” compiled on “Berlin Beats”released on Code 2 Records or his “Euphoria EP” on Formule Records.

As a major actor of Paris electronic music scene, he joined “The Freakshow” collective and became resident of the famous nightclub “Le Batofar” with his eponymous parties (combining burlesque performance and high quality electronic music artists) and also his fresh new concept “Sugoï Club”. He is touring all around the clubs and is playing in events with international renowned artists like Clara Moto, Rodriguez Jr, Dosem, Robosonic, Glimpse, Finnebassen..

What’s next? He is actually developing and working towards with “Le Grand Mechant Loup”, a growing french artist, and both are cooking a heavy analog live under the name of “Telekin”. His next EP will be soon released on SweetWax Recordings and will be out on vinyl and digital, another release is actually planned on That's Some Serious Shit Records and he recently integrated Midnight Social Recordings family and will publish soon the bomb track “Steve Austin Can Run Faster”.

ELYELLA DJs create stunning sonic structures built on the foundations of pop, rock and electronic music. Their spectacular shows break with anything that came before.

With ELYELLA DJs, the world shares smiles, explores new musical directions and remembers songs that marked the recent past… And the good times won’t end until they finish their set.

Whenever they take to the stage, this duo sets the crowd alight with a daring mix of different styles. They are unpredictable and have your heart on a string.

ELYELLA DJs modify the songs we love to get them to fit their eclectic outlook. They have that feeling, that passion for music, that magical ability to connect with their audience. They absorb the freshest sounds of the indie and electronic scene without pulling up walls between different styles. They mix songs in a new, exciting way, releasing them from their comfort zone to lead them to a dimension that can only be understood when you are right there on the dance floor. ELYELLA DJs will leave you gasping for more.

With their energy, good vibes and musical intelligence, it’s hardly surprising that ELYELLA DJs have played major music festivals like Bilbao BBK Live, SOS 4.8, Arenal Sound, Electromar, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim (FIB), FIV Vilalva, Alicante Spring Festival and the London FilmFreakFestival.

ELYELLA DJs have also rocked leading clubs such as the Apolo and Razzmatazz (Barcelona), Ochoymedio and Independance (Madrid), La3 (Valencia), Fever and Sonora (Bilbao), Obbio (Sevilla), Rockers, Stereo and Confetti Club (Alicante), Privilege (Ibiza) and Scala (London).

Starting out in 2010 as ELYELLA DJs. Taking and reshaping every musical style that crosses their path, they charge each beat with a soul so personal that you’ll feel an instant connection.

Those who go and see their show will notice their feet move non-stop and hear themselves sing along to the best tunes out there.
..........................

ELYELLA Djs tienen la manía de crear una impactante arquitectura sónica construida con cimientos de electróncia, muros de pop y rock y en el tejado, puro espectáculo que rompe con cualquier plano.
Con ELYELLA Djs, el mundo comparte sonrisas, explora las nuevas propuestas musicales y recuerda las que marcaron el pasado reciente...y los buenos momentos terminan cuando completan sus sesiones. 
Este dúo se atreve desde la cabina a jugar con los sentimientos de los asistentes a través de la experimentación de diferentes lenguajes musicales, se muestran imprevisibles, no les importa marcar el ritmo cardíaco del público. 
Adulteran las canciones, tal y como las conocemos, para llegar a encajar la parte musical con un concepto de mezclas propio. Tienen ese feeling, esa pasión por la música y la habilidad de comunicar a un tú o a un vosotros multitudinario. Asimilan los sonidos más frescos de la escena indie y de la electónica, sin poner barreras a sus subestilos y lugares de procedencia, los pasan por sus equipos y los sueltan haciéndolos crecer, llevándolos a una dimensión que sólo puede entenderse cuando los tienes frente a frente. Mezclan las canciones y remixes de una manera nueva, excitante e incluso exquisitamente extraña.
Con este derroche de energía, buen rollo y de inteligencia musical, no es extraño que ELYELLA Djs nos hayan regalado grandes momentazos desde los escenarios de los festivales más punteros como SOS 4.8, Arenal Sound, Electromar, Festival Internacional de Benicàssim, FIV Vilalva, Alicante Spring Festival y FilmFreakFestival (Londres). 
También han sacudido las pistas de los clubes más significativos del circuito musical como  Razzmatazz y Apolo (Bcn), Ochoymedio e Indpendance (Madrid),  La3 (Valencia), Fever y Sonora (Bilbao), Obbio (Sevilla), Rockers, Stereo y Confetti Club (Alicante), Privilege (Ibiza) y Scala (Londres).
Desde que comenzaran su carrera en el 2010 como ELYELLA Djs,  no les ha importado qué estilo musical se haya cruzado en su camino, ya que ellos filtran cada beat con su alma para que el público lo sienta como algo personal.

“La confirmación definitiva del romance entre la electrónica y el indie.”

Reinier Zonneveld, known as a live-act as well as a DJ and producer from the Netherlands, is ready to take over the world with his unique view on the genre Techno. He is currently signed on labels like Stil vor Talent, Minus, Tronic, Traum, MBF and Trapez.
Zonneveld is just as comfortable with producing electronic music as with composing classical music. These orchestral skills shine through in his productions. With this very versatile and talented aspect of producing music, he doesn’t get stuck in boundaries of one specific genre. From Ambient to melodic Techno and from Minimal to warehouse pounding Techno. It's all in the mastermind and catalogue of Reinier Zonneveld.
The numerous tracks he has produced received massive support from world class artists around the globe like: Oliver Koletzki, Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Slam, Adam Beyer, Sven Väth, Chris Liebing, Maceo Plex, Dubfire, John Digweed, Pan-Pot, Tocadisco, Monika Kruse, Paco Osuna, Karotte, Pig & Dan, Mark Knight, Gary Beck, Christian Smith, Secret Cinema, Oliver Schories, Marco Carola, 2000 and One, Funkagenda, Steve Lawler, Marco Bailey, Axwell, Armin van Buuren and many, many more. You can ask yourself which DJ hasn’t got some Reinier Zonneveld originals in their arsenal. During 2015 his ‘Trackstomp’ not only got enormous support on the dancefloor, but also on Beatport. The track, released on Christian Smith’s Tronic, stayed in the Techno top 100 tracks for over a month, topping at #30. With that being said his musical future is very promising and we can expect great things from him.
His energetic live performances, perfect for peak time dancefloors, are gaining momentum. This leads to bookings at, for example, the mainstage of Mysteryland in 2015 and the legendary Awakenings Festival in 2016. So be sure to follow Reinier Zonneveld in the future. With plenty of fresh and exciting music, this sound will be the next big thing in the world of techno!",6262,1207,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Reinier-Zonneveld/229511313792092,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Reinier-Zonneveld/229511313792092,https://twitter.com/ReinZonneveld,,"https://play.spotify.com/artist/21A7bhIL1m6CNZn8y57PIZ

All free tunes can be downloaded here: https://soundcloud.com/dj-structure/sets/free-shiznit
     
Structure has always been inspired by music and in the late 80's, he picked up his first set of turntables. Growing up in the suburbs of Boston,there was fierce competition in the DJ industry! Practicing 5-8 hours daily, he finally set out on his own after 5 years.
Structure then moved to Chicago,New York and finally landed in Georgia where he now calls home. Once he won the 2001 Atlanta ""Summer Skool"" DJ Battle for the Breakbeats category,the shows started pouring in. Playing gigs for major promoters from Tennessee,Florida,Alabama,New Mexico and Georgia just to name a few.
   Structure soon realized it was time to step it up a notch and jump in the producer game! Within the last 6 years,he's released 32 tracks on most major online retailers through labels such as ""Heavy Artillery,Bombeatz,ShiftAxis Records,Samoa Good Music,Crescent Records,Pooty Club Records(Spain),Distorsion Records(Spain),Wobble Records(Italy),Monkey Dub(Canada)"" and many more. 13 of those tracks gained him top 100 singles on Beatport. A handful of those made it as far as top 20 with several hitting top 10. With his ""Non Genre"" specific style,he has since focused his attention on remixing classic tunes and giving them away for free on Soundcloud! With his unique take on Bass music and remixing ability,he's quickly approaching the 1 million plays mark!!!

Midnight City are Jonny Hayes and Josh Jones, a house music duo hailing from Merseyside, UK. Formed in late 2013, the duo are rapidly becoming a notable name on the house music circuit.

Dedicated to delivering real house music, based on the philosophies the genre was founded on; soul, groove, positive vibes and a beat you can dance to, Midnight City have secured a cult following of loyal fans from the UK and beyond.

Championed by countless big names, and having already reached UK Top 5 status, after co-producing the Philip George & Anton Powers hit 'Alone No More' (3beat/Universal), plus releases set for several established record labels (including Tough Love's 'Get Twisted' imprint on Sony/Columbia), it's not hard to see why Midnight City are swiftly rising through the house music ranks.

Chris and Max met at a Music Festival in early 2010, got into talking an decided to put together some beats the next few days.
Three years later, after having worked their way through the local electronic music scene and various different genres, they finally discovered the power of the ""four-on-the-floor""-beat.

In 2013 Naxxos was formed.

Driven by countless influences, they try to combine blissful, smashing riffs with soulful and organic rhythms.
Inspired by music all over world, Naxxos try to cross as many borders as possible, musical as well as geographical.

Finding support all over Europe, especially in France, and finally having found a music scene that they could really cherish, Chris and Max decided to put all their love and energy into their music.

David’s music is the soundtrack to my soul.” – Zan Roberts

“The Human Experience” is David Block’s principal project as a live
electronic composer, multi-instrumentalist, producer. Listeners
experience a delicious symphonic blend of prismatic soundscapes and
sultry beats.

David is constantly pushing the boundaries of live electronic music.
Playing, composing, and conducting his own electronic symphony live on
stage, his performances are brimming and layered with human emotion,
world exploration, and sacred sounds. Whether performing by himself,
or with a live band, “The Human Experience” always delivers an
emotionally charged show.

“The Human Experience” aims to cross cultural barriers through music.
David has collaborated with artists all over the world including
Ignacio Perez (Buena Vista Social Club), Rising Appalachia, William Close (The Earth Harp), Random Rab, Govinda, and many
others.

Since his debut album “Inaudible Sounds” in 2010 , he has released 9 other
albums in the last four years and has at least 2 new projects planned for release
in 2015.  Each song is a sonic journey; interweaving psychedelic
layers of melody and harmony with organic grooves and international
vibes.

Composing and performing live with the Audio/Visual/Dance
projects “Phadroid” (Andrew and Phaedra Jones), “Quixotic”, “Lucent Dossier”,
and “Seraphim” David is expanding his sounds into the mixed media
world.

Since 2010, David has performed all over the world sharing the stage
with renowned artists such as, Thievery Corporation, Bonobo, Tipper,
Random Rab, Emancipator, Bluetech, Kalya Scintilla, and Kaminanda.

Over the last three years he has toured in England,
Portugal, Germany, Russia, Israel, Costa Rica, Mexico, Guatemala,
Canada, and all over
the United States at a variety of events including festivals like
Boom, Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle, Satya, Symbiosis, and
Envision.

David is consistently redefining himself as an artist, performer, and
human being. Moving and traveling around the world, meeting people
from all walks of life and realms of consciousness, he is continually
learning, growing, and sharing inspiration with those around him.

“We don’t play music, music plays us” – David Block

At a fundamental level
We are more than just billions of atoms
We are all vibrations
We are all sounds
Everything in the universe
Is a sound
Ones thoughts
Ones intentions
Are sounds
Our love
Our fears
Are sounds
Our Hopes
Our Dreams
Are sounds
Vibrations
Inaudible sounds

All songs are the original compositions/productions/arrangements/Mixes of David Block
(The HumanExperience).

Songs listed as “live” were performed, mixed, orchestrated, and recorded live on the Roland Fantom X8 by The Human Experience and are unedited. All parts played by The Human Experience unless otherwise noted.

Ray Mang,Creative,,http://soundcloud.com/ray-mang,fergus@solarmanagement.co.,"UK DJ / Producer / Remixer and all-round studio boffin, known to his mates as Raj Gupta, is definitely not a new boy on the Disco Dance scene.  He landed his first 12” Number One in ’96 on Noid Recordings gaining widespread support in the clubs and on compilations.  Over Fifteen years on it’s still a much sought after underground classic.

He went on to set up his own record label Mangled in ’98 unleashing a slew of well-received and highly collectable 12” releases.  Two albums followed ‘Mangled’ on Eskimo Recordings and later ‘Mangled Again’ on his own imprint along with singles on R & S, Bear Funk & Smash Hit.  Recently his release on DFA saw him offer P-Funk with a Disco House twist made for the dance floor (Bullet Proof feat the brilliant Lady Miss Kier) and a blissed out Balearic gem (Look Into My Eyes which featured on the Ministry Underground Disco compilation).

Add to this a list of other projects / collaborations through the years (including Block 16 and Motif for seminal 90’s UK label Nuphonic Records, working as Laj with the Idjut Boys on U-Star or Quakerman on their own Fiasco imprint) along with some close musical acquaintances (The Glimmers, Foolish Felix, Lee Tong, Nathan D’Troit) and you have one of the most prolific contributors to the Boogie/Disco/House canon this side of the nineties.

As a remixer both on his own and with old pals The Glimmers he’s notched up credits for  Lassigue Bendthaus, Banda Black Rio, Gorillaz, Shirley Bassey, Grand National, Roxy Music, Doves, Beck, The Phenomenal Handclap Band, Freddie Mercury, Bloc Party, 2020 Soundsystem & Friendly Fires to name just a few.  Recent and forthcoming remixes include Cadillac, Odyssey, Kris Menace, Rune Lindbaek featuring Kurt Maloo, Planet Jumper, Mari, Fernando, Soft Rocks, Aliço vs	Çağrı, Munk, Los Amigos Invisibles vs Dimitri From Paris, Daniel Grau, Bryan Ferry, Rob Garza & Neighbour, Paqua, Volta Cab, U-Ka, Daniel Baldelli & Rocca and many more.
 
As a DJ the Mang has been touring internationally for many years across Europe, the UK and Asia (touring Japan four times). His accomplished sets mixing dance music from the last 40 years with more recent disco, cosmic / Balearic, house and some of his own forthcoming productions have been setting dancefloors alight and winning him new fans.

<B>Bio - </B>

For a scene that was once brewing quietly in the deepest darkest depths of South London, it’s remarkable to see Dubsteps original spacious and organic sound influence heads as far afield as New Zealand. With pioneers Truth leading the way, a thriving hub of 140 producers has been unearthed and among the brightest prospects are Perverse a.k.a. Auckland City representatives Brett & Alex.

Inspired by a range of genres from the 808’s and lean of hiphop to the twisted rhythms of hard Drum and Bass luminaries Noisia, Black Sun Empire and Spor, Perverse were drawn to production through their collective love of bass heavy music. Purveyors of intensely dark and uncompromising eyes-down beats, their sound is exemplified by a precise control over shuddering sub frequencies and a minimal sparseness of construction reminiscent of early Loefah or Kryptic Minds. Whilst their musical influences are notable, Perverse bring their own unique and refreshing take on the sound, with a repertoire of versatile riddims infused with intelligent syncopated beats and chest caving low end.

Perverse are rapidly building a prolific reputation and armed with a formidable collection of lethal dubs they have found their productions unleashed in the sets of Mala, Kryptic Minds, Youngsta, Distance, Biome, J:Kenzo, Vivek, Jack Sparrow, Seven and Icicle, delivering trademark clean bass weight, razor sharp percussion and desolate atmospherics. Heavy radio play is further testament to their current prowess, receiving airtime on internationally acclaimed stations including Youngsta, Distance, Jay 5ive and Crisis on their respective Rinse FM shows, and on scene stalwart BunZer0’s Sub.fm show which has long been a tide marker for exciting talent.

Labels have been quick to recognize Perverse’s superior sub-bass architecture with multiple releases on various labels.
This is music that has to be heard on earth moving sound systems and equipped with flawless execution behind the decks, expect to witness Alex and Brett mashing up a dance somewhere near you soon.

After receiving widespread recognition for books like “How Does He Do It?” and “Glorious Misunderstandings,” Maurits Verwoerd decided to start a career as a music producer. Though few doubted his skills as an artist, most of Maurits neighbours thought different about his compositions, causing him to start producing music in the underground dungeons of Amsterdam. Coming out occasionally, but only at night, slowly made him well known among friends and enemies as Nachtbraker (Dutch for night hawk). 
The signs of exposure to a wide range of genres are clearly hearable in his music, ranging from ecstatic slow grooves to unconventional dub tracks. Critics often praise him for adopting a wide pallet of sounds and subtle, detailed percussion. While his celebrated performances receive increasing recognition, it’s unquestionable that Nachtbraker will keep a lot of people comfortably awake for the coming years.

Sometimes, I ask myself if my aspirations are insane. Sometimes, I whisper to the immaculate expanse before me to hear myself echo in return.  At some point, you realize that stumbling along a passage that's laid out for you isn't living a life. We walk among the stars, yet live locked in coffers. The only limit you have, is the limit you place on yourself. 

Fuck limits.

Dan Castro started producing just over fiver years ago and has since attracted the attention of some of the World's Biggest House Artists including Laidback Luke, Axwell, Tiesto, David Guetta, Pete Tong (Radio 1 Support), Mark Knight, Roger Sanchez, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Riva Starr, Chuckie, MYNC, Dirty Vegas & Many more.

Since this point, Dan has gone on to enjoy consistent success in the Beatport charts, reaching Number 6 in the Overall Beatport Chart/No.2 in the House chart with his track 'High Tide' (Cr2 Records) and reaching the Beatport house Top 10 on multiple occasions with the help of tracks such as 'Eastern Ensemble' and in 2010 (his first year of releases), he enjoyed success as an Essential Contender on Pete Tong's Radio 1 show on two occasions with Pete touting Dan's remix of 'The Mistress' a 'Future Anthem In The Making'. He has already had six plays on Pete Tong's show which is the holy grail of all DJs and Producer’s aims.

In addition to this, he has acquired the support off the National UK Radio, Capital FM and has featured on David Guetta's Radio show, Tiesto's 'Club Life' Radio Show (Tiesto playing two tracks of Dan's in one of his shows!) and Radio FG on Laidback Luke's show and more...

However, Dan does not see himself as just a Producer, but a DJ before all of this and due to his success, has managed to climb onto the international circuit already playing gigs in Sweden, Paris, Lille, Ibiza (Space), Amsterdam, Croatia, London, Indonesia and so on and enjoys playing a variety of genres, utilising many of his own personal Bootlegs and Re-edits for his gigs. He also made his debut for Ministry of Sound, playing in Hong Kong.

Dan's tour schedule has also taken him to Miami, playing alongside artists such as the Black Eyed Peas, Chuckie, Yolanda Be Cool, Tristan Garner, Sebastien Drums, The Stafford Brothers and more...

Dan also received an ‘honourable mention’ as best performing DJ of the year from Entertaining Asia (John Stephen), just behind the likes of Alex Gaudino and Fedde Le Grande.

MORE THAN AN EDIT: THE REFLEX REVISION

Nile Rodgers is a fan. Kid Creole is a fan. Disclosure, Jazzy Jeff, and Joris Voorn are all fans. From house music royalty Joey Negro, Dimitri from Paris and Mousse T, to the original DJ - remix pioneers John Morales, Greg Wilson, Danny Krivit, and Nicky Siano, all the way to Aeroplane, DJ Marky, Kruder & Dorfmeister, Horse Meat Disco, J.Rocc, Nic Fanciulli, Jazzie B, Cut Killer, Rainer Truby, Acid Arab, Nightmares on Wax… They are all fans of The Reflex.

Fascinated by the remix from an early age, London-based French native Nicolas Laugier, aka The Reflex, takes his cue from the first wave of disco remixers by using only the original sounds from the master tapes (or stems) to breathe new life into soul, pop and disco classics. Imaginative arrangements, boxfresh sonics and intricate editing make The Reflex Revisions rocket fuel for every DJ set. 
Very few editors out there put as much time and detail into their work as The Reflex and the results speak for themselves: heavily championed by BBC6 Music’s Craig Charles, The Reflex Revisions have amassed over 50 weeks of radio play in just two years on this number one rated show. They have also found their way onto the playlists of tastemakers like Rob Da Bank, and Gilles Peterson, who last year sent the Michael Jackson ‘Rock With You’ Revision spinning around the globe. 
But, it’s not all about the past for The Reflex; Nicolas has also been applying his stems-only formula to contemporary tracks, showing off the strength of his ‘less is more’ approach on production to a wider audience. Having clearly established himself as one of the best in the remix field, with two official compilations of revisions in the works and gigs lined up all over the planet, now is the time to sit up and take notice of this French DJ / producer doing it his way.
There are edits, many of them. Then there are The Reflex Revisions – quite simply… next level.

How to pronounce LiTek: ""Lie-Tek""

@thisisechelon
Get Twisted | Parlophone | Nite Records | Love & Other

Most people who make a career out of music start young, but LiTek already knew aged just 13 what he wanted to do with his life. At that age he was already struck by the DJing bug and has barely taken his digits off the decks ever since. He has a passion for house that has lead his to explore every niche of the genre over the years, and so his DJ sets are well informed things that make dance floors move with a keen grasp of mood and groove. His efforts have secured him a spot with the Echelon collective and have have seen him pick up great support from ever more taste making DJs in the know. Always editing and remixing tracks to make his own sets more special and energetic, LiTek never does the same trick twice. He is also getting attention from major labels for the bangers he drops (such as the massive Dreams or All Around the World, which are melodically playful cuts with rude boy bas and swung garage beats making you want to move) and is often played on cult radio stations all around the world.

Based in the northern outpost of Manchester and the Midlands hotbed of Leicester, LiTek plies his trades in clubs most night of the week and so really can work any crowd into a frenzy. He has lots of great projects in the world and is always prepping for that next big gig. As such, LiTek is definitely one to watch out for in the coming years.

Stephen Hill || C-SIDE
info@csidemanagement.com
------------------------------------------
Born and raised in Stockholm, Hellbergs love for music started at the tender age of 3, when he first began his one-man-shows for his family on his imaginary guitar. By the age of 13 he was introduced to the world of electronic music. From that early discovery, he was hooked, music has played a huge part in his life ever since.

Looking back at it Hellberg remembers spending countless hours in front of the computer grinding on his craft. By always prioritizing his music he missed out on more social events, parties and family activities than he cares to remember.

 

After many years of hard work Hellberg reached an important milestone in his career with his single ’The Girl’ feat, Cozi Zuehlsdorff, which was the first single of his EP titled ‘This Is Me’. The single saw fantastic results as it was Monstercat’s most streamed track of 2015, totaling more than 12 million streams. The EP was the start of a new chapter for Hellberg as it set the tone for Hellbergs evolved sound.

 

Hellbergs unbelievable work ethic and his astonishing dedication to his craft pushes him to always outdo himself. He does everything in his power to always deliver music that he feels and believes is a true testimony of his love for music.

\\ These spiritual window-shoppers,
      who idly ask, 'How much is that?' Oh, I'm just looking.
      They handle a hundred items and put them down,
      shadows with no capital.

       What is spent is love and two eyes wet with weeping.
      But these walk into a shop,
      and their whole lives pass suddenly in that moment,
      in that shop.

       Where did you go? ""Nowhere.""
      What did you have to eat? ""Nothing much.""

       Even if you don't know what you want,
      buy _something,_ to be part of the exchanging flow.

       Start a huge, foolish project,
      like Noah.

       It makes absolutely no difference
      what people think of you.

I was once the leader of an intergalactic robot alliance that was sent to this place to destroy the planet Earth. Once here, a series of divinely inspired prophecies were fulfilled, and my mission was aborted. Not content with returning to the evil grasp of the Universal Republic, I laid down my command over the robot forces and decided to stay on this strange planet they called Earth. My new mission was to teach humans the lost secrets of the ancient cosmos, bridge their souls with the farthest reaches of space, and open their hearts to the wonders of the universe with music.

Music Needs Emotions!
This is exactly what you get when you listen to Sebastien.
His productions speak volumes. They bear a one-of-a-kind signature.
His music – guided by emotions, yet underlined with technical excellence. This is how the „scene“ would describe him: a producer with attention to detail.
His productions resemble a perfectly matched 5 star menu of the Melodic Deep House Culture, in which every instrument and every vocal are perfectly blended together.
It is this very passionate love for perfection that makes Sebastien stand out.
This pleasant  northern German’s lad's remix productions of Moby, twoloud or Röyksopp only a tiny part of his artful producer skills for his very own productions are played and supported by the DJ elite, too.
All those who like to relax and dream away should definitely see his performances. They will enjoy a delightful mix of rolling beats paired with emotional melodies taking you to another world.
It is not just a DJ set you will listen to -  you will actually „take in“ Sebastien! Go for it!

Sandy Rivera aka K.O.T,Creative,Sandy Rivera,http://soundcloud.com/sandy-rivera,tom@colludedtalent.com,"BOOKINGS CONTACT: tom@colludedtalent.com
emma@yeloagency.com (ASIA ONLY)
MANAGEMENT CONTACT: aaron@infinitefuture.co.uk

As one of the most highly regarded producers of his – or any other – generation, Sandy Rivera’s place in house music history is already assured. Recording under both his own name and his legendary Kings of Tomorrow moniker, Rivera’s unparalleled creativity and gift for forging timeless house records have placed him in a league of his own, and without him the house landscape would boast a far less richly coloured vista. 
For many, Rivera will be best known for the seminal ‘Finally’, Kings of Tomorrow’s magnum opus and a record that stands as one of the finest vocal house record ever made. Released on Defected Records – a label with which Rivera has enjoyed a staggeringly fruitful relationship over the years – ‘Finally’ still resonated more than a decade later. However, to only know ‘Finally’ is to merely scratch the surface of Rivera’s exemplary catalogue.

Long-players The Calling (1997), It’s In The Lifestyle (2000) and Trouble (2005) roundly demonstrate Rivera’s wide-ranging talents and ability to incorporate a vast array of stylistic influences into his music. Elements from soul, funk, disco, techno, pop and everything in between are commonplace in his records, Rivera drawing on the myriad influences Puerto Rican heritage and New York upbringing to craft records that are at once familiar and utterly unique.
Aside for his many solo offerings, collaboration has always been a key part of Rivera’s recording career, ‘SOTOM’ alongside Danish artist Noir and ‘I Remember’ with C.Castel – released on Rivera’s own Blackwiz Records – standing as recent highlights. Reacha little further back into the Rivera canon and you’ll find a sometimes overlooked gem, EBTG & Soul Vision (Rivera and Jose Burgos) ‘Tracy In My Room’ – a truly iconic record with Soul Vision’s rolling production perfectly complimenting Tracy Thor’s sultry vocals. Known for working with highly talented singers and songwriters Haze (‘Changes’), Robert Owens (‘Just Won’t Do’) and Elzi Hall (‘Show Me’) Rivera has found something of a muse in recent years in the UK’s April. Having previously released two EPs with April on vocals – ‘I Need To Love Me’ and 2013’s sensational’ ‘Fall For You’, we’re now presented with their third and most poignant collaboration to date ‘Bang’ via Ultra / Sony Music.

Also forthcoming is a remix for Jennifer Hudson & R-Kelly’s release “It’s Your World” and collaborations with Roger Sanchez & Hector Couto. 

In years to come, Sandy Rivera will be looked back on as one of the true greats to the scene; a pioneering artist whose passion for house music is continually realised in the music he creates. For now though, with the 20th anniversary re-brand of Blackwiz just around the corner and the re-launch of his seminal label Deep Vision, he’s still busy creating his legacy: long may he continue.

Up-and-coming British producer Dave Silcox is at the forefront of the England's new big room sound. The talented youngster capped a successful 2015 with the release of his 'All Or Nothing' with D.O.D & Little Nikki on Laidback Luke's Mixmash Records then followed up with a remix of Thomas Gold - Colourblind with Matt Nash on Rvealed Recordings. Current releases are a remix of Matt Nash - Nothing Else Matters & 'No Sleep' with Kash Simic due for release on 8th June on MOS Aus/Downright Music

At 25 years old, Silcox already has releases on Revealed, Spinnin', Diffused, and Toolroom under his belt. Drawing on myriad musical influences, Silcox showcases hard energy in electro bangers and a melodic euphoria and anthemic chord progressions in his progressive tunes. ""I think my production style, too, is evident in my DJ sets. I have a wide musical taste and I like to keep people on their toes and never quite sure what to expect next."" Silcox, who holds a Gatecrasher residency, has performed at Creamfields (UK), Burning Man (USA) will continue to tour throughout Europe before embarking on his debut North America tour in early 2014.

His tracks have been featured on BBC 1 Radio by Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, and Fearne Cotton and supported by Afrojack, Hardwell, Sander van Doorn, Chuckie, Gareth Emery, Thomas Gold, Carnage, and others.

Bio:
Hailing from the North-Western city of Dryden, Ontario, Eklo has firmly placed his mark on the electronic community and his surrounding peers. His melodic, yet raw & acoustic sound has already gained him props from industry heavyweights such as: Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Robin Schulz, Sam Feldt and Flic Flac. Making the last 12 months nothing short of defining for this promising producer. From the humble beginnings of Northern Ontario, Eklo has carved himself a widely praised repertoire in the melodic and deep house scene. His most notable original, ‘Let's Go Home’ reaching half a million people within the first 5 months of it’s release. Guitarist, songwriter, vocalist and producer, Eklo’s talent appears to have no bounds. Such talent was recognised by renowned dance label, Spinnin’ Records in June 2015 when they secured the talented producer to a recording partnership. Since then, Eklo has released his first track with Spinnin in September of 2015 & continues to inspire others with his emotive and feel-good sound. This appears to be only the beginning to the success of this talented, focused and ambitious producer.",10189,10,https://www.facebook.com/iameklo,https://www.facebook.com/iameklo,https://twitter.com/iameklo,,"http://open.spotify.com/artist/3TlZLU8gQBrjTGJlLLDruk

What the fuck is a Teddy Cream? 
Rewind back to 2010, two young individuals at the ripe age of 13 come together to make a one off track.. Unknowing to them this one song would set off a motion of events, and an everlasting friendship, leading to one of the hottest young duo’s to have ever risen out of the Melbourne club scene.

Today these boys go by none other than Teddy Cream. They have grown in stature since those early days and have been voted #6 best DJ act in Australia at the 2015 ITM awards in Sydney.

They have destroyed dance floors all over Australia and have started to travel the world, playing in South Korea, Indonesia, Scotland, Ireland & more.

Phantasie, Einfühlungsvermögen, musikalische Version und natürlich ein untrügliches Gespür für die Trends von übermorgen – Eigenschaften, die einen guten Künstler erst von einem hervorragenden Künstler unterscheiden. Der Leipziger DJ und Producer David K. besitzt alle vier im Überfluss, wie der 26-Jährige bereits mit seinen gefeierten Remixen für Robin Schulz, Tiesto oder Faul bewiesen hat. Pünktlich zu den beginnenden Sommerfestivals startet David K. nun so richtig durch. Mit im Programm: Sein brandneues Club-Brett „Like The Dawn (David K. Remix)“

Er ist auf dem Sprung an die absolute Spitze einer ganz neuen Generation von DJs und Producern, die statt auf durchgehend wummernde Bässe und stumpfe Hands-in-the-Air-Parts mehr Wert auf Atmosphäre und Emotion, wie auch auf Tanzbarkeit legen: Mit seinen Mixen, Tracks und Edits wie seinem viel beachteten Debüt-Tune „Meet You“ sowie dem ebenso begeistert aufgenommenen Follow-Up „Open Eyes“ hat sich David K. ab 2012 innerhalb kürzester Zeit eine stetig wachsende Fanbase erspielt – heute wird der Leipziger als das kommende Next big Thing innerhalb der europäischen Deep House-Szene gehandelt. Ein kommender Shootingstar, der allerbeste Chancen hat, selbst Robin Schulz schon bald seinen Thron als momentan erfolgreichster deutscher Clubhitlieferant ernsthaft streitig zu machen! Bereits Anfang des Jahres war David K. auf der renommierten Winter Music Conference in Miami nach Robin Schulz an den Turntables vor einer absolut geflashten Crowd zu erleben.

Als „gut ausgewogenes Mittelding aus romantischen Vibes und Clubtauglichkeit“ bezeichnet David K. selbst seinen sanft nach vorne pushenden Signature-Sound, auf dem sich warme, akustische Elemente mit einer fließenden Bassline und treibenden Beats zu einem melancholisch-entspannten, tanzbaren Mix verbinden. „Einerseits ein wenig verschmust, andererseits geht es absolut nach vorne“, so David über seine ganz eigene Interpretation von Melodic Deep House. „Ich würde meinen Style als melodiösen House mit Vocals und organischen Instrumenten beschreiben. Mich selbst würde ich als Romantiker bezeichnen; das spiegelt sich auch irgendwie in meinen Tracks wider. Ich mag es, aus ruhigen, schönen Songs tanzbare Clubtunes zu basteln. Ich fände es toll, wenn die Leute zum Sonnenaufgang an einem Strand zu meinen Tracks abfeiern. Eine sehr schöne Vorstellung.“

Bereits im Alter von 14 Jahren hat der erklärte Nachtmensch David K. mit dem Auflegen begonnen; nach Zwischenstationen in lokalen Clubs sowie Sets in ganz Deutschland, Österreich, Ungarn, Belgien, der Schweiz, Holland und den USA hat sich der 22-Jährige mittlerweile bis auf die Stages großer Festivals wie dem SonneMondSterne oder der Sputnik Spring Break hoch gespielt. Und auch als gefragter Remixer hat sich David K. einen exzellenten Namen gemacht: So zeichnet er u.a. verantwortlich für Remixe von Robin Schulz` „Headlights (feat. Ilsey)“, Tiestos „Light Years Away“ und Fauls „Something New“.

Und auch mit seinem nächsten Clubhit, einem Remix des Folksongs „Like The Dawn“ vom texanischen Duo The Oh Hellos, sorgt David K. schon jetzt für rappelvolle Tanzflächen. The Oh Hellos „Like The Dawn (David K. Remix)“ erscheint am 01.05.2015 über Tonspiel/ Warner Music.",27592,105,http://www.facebook.com/DavidK.official,http://www.facebook.com/DavidK.official,https://twitter.com/DavidK_Official,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6q1dUQXV7gSy_sWIgXy9A?feature=mhee,"http://www.dusteddecks.de

Since 2011, Sobcek have been generating serious blog heat around the world thanks to a handful of beautifully constructed official remixes (Housse de Racket, Bastille, Chilly Gonzales, Sebastien Schuller among others) and the release of 2 EPS (Je me souviens and Miami) which brought them also to mainstream exposure on french TV (M6, W9, MTV Pulse....)

In 2012, their cover of the Hall and Oates classic “She´s Gone” was picked by Les Inrockuptibles to feature on their covers compilation with among other Hot Chip, Brigitte and José Gonzalès.

In 2014, 3rd EP: ""Midnight Crush"" feat. Mereki.
Sobcek produced the first EP of french hedonist-pop band Destin on Polydor / Universal Music.

klangkuenstler,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/klangkuenstler,booking@stilvortalent.de,"booking@stilvortalent.de 

Sometimes in arts, but certainly in life and especially in the art of sound: the eye and the ear are equal partners. Talking about the young and talented KlangKuenstler, you have to add another organ of perception: the heart. Music without emotion is useless. Emotional music reminds us that we shouldn’t think about yesterday or tomorrow, what counts is solely to enjoy here and now. Music should preserve our feelings, tickle out our endorphins and – in the best case – be a joyful escapism from the hectic everyday life. Welcome to the world of KlangKuenstler!

In 2012, the 22-year-old Michael Korb choose the way from bavarian solitude to the center of hustle and bustle when he moved to germany’s capital – Berlin calling! Only a few years before, he had his first contact with electronic music. His enthusiasm was activated by his first club experience in Munich, which came along like a revelation: loud music, people are dancing, the colorful lights and smiling faces everywhere. At the age of 20 years, his passion begins to professionalize. The KlangKuenstler start digging records and was looking for new and inspiring music. No, not the common chart material thrilled him; he was seeking for fresh tunes and a home for his first productions. In 2011, he founded the label “Zuckerton Records” to release his music and give other artists with a unique style a platform for their music.

His music is warm, mellow, and soft; it embodies a cheerfulness that you can describe like the perfect match between romance and hedonism. On his first productions indicates that KlangKuenstler is a musing dreamer: His track “Freudentraene” was a huge milestone in his young career and with three million plays on Youtube quite a success. 

It is said that nature gives a man his abilities, and the happiness brings them into effect. Talking about the KlangKuenstler, we have to add his almost impressive talent. With releases on labels as “Stil Vor Talent”, he has created an inimitable style and his own voice, which honors his alter ego: his deep and tech house is not only in love with melodies, but passionately produced. Think of a kaleidoscope that captures a variety of different colors. Whether it's jazz, soul, funk or his great passion for pathetic sensual strings – out of several mosaics he creates a total work of art that simply sprays a positive vibe.

Although he appears as a DJ from time to time, KlangKuenstler is first and foremost a live act, which wants to introduce his own productions in the club. Here he cannot only engage spontaneously to the particular mood of the crowd, but also arrange his own tracks in an always new and appealing way. On the Berlin based label Stil vor Talent he released his single ""Barfuss auf Wolken"", which is not only a highlight of his set, but already reached 1 000 000 000 plays on Soundcloud. The track is also featured on Oliver Koletzki’s „Schneeweiß Compilation II“. 

It does not need a glimpse in the crystal ball to predict a promising future for KlangKuenstler. In 2014, his debut album „That's Me“  was released. The long player embodies his own compass – it indicates his origins, his current status as an emerging live act and suggests new directions he will follow. Whether epic chords, his fetish for grasping bass lines or these joyful melodies – „That's Me“ is a multi-faceted, atmospheric and first and last a very emotional record. It is such a heavenly sensation to follow his heart.

There are producers whose work is immediately associated with success, and whose talent for seeking out new national and international voices is celebrated. There are only a few like this in the german music industry. Mousse T.’s Discography reads like a “Who’s Who” of the music scene. His songs “Horny” and “Sex Bomb” have provided a good example of the power harnessed when intuition and precision come together. In 1993 (yes, that’s almost 20 years ago!) he founded the label “Peppermint Jam Records”, along with the owners of Peppermint Park Studios and his partner Errol Rennalls. At this time Mousse T. was starting to make a name for himself as a DJ on a wider stage. Several productions with international greats such as Ziggy Marley, Mezzoforte and Randy Crawford were done during this time. In 1998 the single “Horny” catapults the name “MOUSSE T.” into the international charts and establishes him as a solo artist. In the same year, further productions for musicians including Michael Jackson cause a sensation and earn him a Grammy nomination as “best remixer” and, later on, the prestigious Ivor Novello award.
Mousse T. was always driven by his curiosity for experimenting with new musical variations combined with his outstanding creative ability. “Of course I feel very proud when I look at my discography. But success for me is important mainly as a basis on which my further work as an artist can flourish. Apart from that, success is, of course, a great motivation and source of energy so that I can continue to give ‘more than 100%’.”

After two albums (“Gourmet De Funk” in 2002 and “All Nite Madness” in 2004, which included numerous hits like “Is It ‘cos I’m Cool?”, “Pop Muzak” and “Right About Now”) plus several productions with artists like Roachford and a movie score for the German movie ""Pornorama"", a further highlight of his career followed in Fall 2007 when Mousse T. presented his songs with a full orchestra. True to the motto ""Re-Orchestrated"", he performed his biggest hits live together with the Filmorchestra Babelsberg, his live band and several guest stars at the Nikolaisaal Potsdam near Berlin. The recording remained in the Top 10 of the iTunes album charts for several weeks.

When he’s not producing Mousse T. can be found all around the globe, spinning records in the hottest and most well-known House clubs. Besides his own latest productions, his sets feature the latest Club hits, classics and several “secret weapons” to make the crowds go crazy, always under the claim of his label “The House Of Quality”. Besides, his love of music can also be found in his monthly podcasts and radio DJ shows for prestigious German radio programmes 1LIVE and N-JOY.

Right now, Mousse T. is working on his 3rd artist album for Universal Records.

Being friends since our childhood, we began composing pop music almost 10 years ago and felt in love with melodic house in 2014. Ofenbach is reflecting this new love and adventure. We want to thank you all for making our music alive and supporting us. Much love.

Sinister Souls create their own vision of filthy Dubstep, with inspiration from Drum 'n Bass, Rave, Breakcore and Techno. 

Sinister Souls already reached some big achievements since they started in 2009. From being in the Beatport top 5 chart with their debut EP ""Definition of Silence"" on Rottun Recordings, to playing at festivals like Q-Base and Qore 3.0 in the Heineken Music Hall Amsterdam.

With lots of gigs in their own little country, foreign bookings in countries like Germany, Portugal and the US pave the way for their destructive sounds. Their debut album just released on PRSPCT Recordings. Get ready for some killer original material and collaborations with, among others, Counterstrike and The Outside Agency. Their sounds are picked up by the likes of Black Sun Empire, Dieselboy, Excision, Bar9, Counterstrike, SPL, DJ Promo, Borgore, Balkansky, Loop Stepwalker and many more.

and rare groove influences and a harmonious combination of astral landscapes, one might
think BMB recorded his material on the West Coast two decades ago.

In his nascent career he has toured extensively in Russia and Europe sharing the stage with
everyone from HudMo and Ras G through to MF Doom and Wu Tang. Whether he is cruising in
the back of a red drop top or on stage, BMB Spacekid knows how to hammer an MPC with
devastating effect.

Previously a participant in Red Bull’s prestigious Bass Camp plus teaching at the Goethe-Institute
in Hamburg as part of their Hip Hop Academy, BMB’s prolific output never sacrifices on quality.
One up and coming US rapper in particular by the name of Goldlink took notice: he jumped on a
BMB instrumental from the vaults and created the silky yet hard hitting “Playah.”

His first UK release comes on vinyl via brand-new label The Full Hundred and we couldn't be
happier to have signed this Russian prodigy who sets to deliver an EP that’s mature beyond his
years.

They say two heads are better than one, but check out what you can achieve with three. London residents Archie Ward, George Renwick and James Levey have pulled together the perfect formula for electronic musical bliss.

Known as ‘Felon’, their star has elevated significantly in the last year through the colossal viral consumption of their credible house grooves. Honeyed vocals and shimmering keys induce sheer elation, whilst rhythmatic precision bass arrangement feeds the soul on a deeper level.

Winter 2013 saw the trio sign their first creation ‘Isla’ featuring a live performance from The Sax Man (Ben Barnett) with Fat! Records, which became the label’s best selling track on Beatport within weeks.

Forward thinking Ibizian travel agency Together featured Isla as the soundtrack of their 2013 promotional video and shortly after the YouTube house music institutions were hot on the trail. Reposts from The Sound You Need & Eton Messy; propelled them further into the stratosphere of the wider house community with over 2 million views online and rising daily.

The trio started working on a live show incorporating their Maschines, Ableton and other toys from the studio, in early 2014…, causing bookings in Croatia, Belgium, Switzerland, Ibiza and Australia to flood in. Headlining the Groove Garden stage at Standon Calling Festival and supporting Chase & Status at Amnesia Ibiza; plus an exclusive signing to the innovative Ultra Records; Felon’s uplifting modern day disco is capturing the hearts and minds of many.",13878,23,http://facebook.com/felonmusicuk,http://facebook.com/felonmusicuk,http://twitter.com/felonmusicuk,,,6,ar@lmrentertainment.co.Ellis@platformagency.co.

Bio:
""Words will inevitably fail to properly describe Freddy Todd. Genre-busting could be an understatement. You can't pin him down with lexicon like lazer-bass and glitch-funk; these phrases fall way short of capturing the expressiveness, fearlessness, and space-traveling qualities of his music. Hearing his music is akin to being abducted by an extra-terrestrial cruise liner where everyone is tripping on space liquid. And if you are lucky enough to witness him produce, you'll see that he fittingly looks just like the captain of said space cruiser, both hands intently gripping his electronics like the instrument panel on the flight deck.

With heavyweight festivals like Coachella, Shambhala, Electric Forest, and Wakarusa to name a few under his belt as well as close ties and collaborations with rockstars like GRiZ, Space Jesus, Thriftworks, Russ Liquid, Mr. Bill, and a handful of other wizard-level jest-stars, there's no stopping this weird and thunderous aerial roll.

Let's bring this back to earth real quick: his motown, soul, blues, jazz, funk, hiphop (and techno for that matter) roots are a given, being born just outside of Detroit in Southfield, MI in 1990. Freddy moved out of his parents house immediately upon turning 18 lusting for the world and the creative juices it has to offer, living briefly in Ferndale, MI at first, then to the outskirts of a rougher part of the city of Detroit near 7 mile and Lahser for two years to live with his jam-tronica progressive rock synth-funk band ""Tone Poets"", producing for Scrummage hip-hop queen ""Breezee One"", and wrapping up his second full length studio LP on Simplify Recordings, followed by a year in Chicago working closely with good friend and producer Ludlow (Elfkowitz).
After living in the midwest until the age of 22, his sights were set on the golden west. Moving cross-country and living two years in the Bay Area, living in both the hood of West Oakland followed by the Oakland Hills while writing and releasing the ""Golden Tremendous"" album on Lowtemp and starting his next EP. After soaking up the Cali vibes, he returned across country for a more wholesome less-congested life-style in the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains in the Appalachians of Asheville, NC (home of Moog Analog Synthesizers) to be closer to family, where he currently resides.

FT is truly a master of his craft not only in the studio but on stages across the globe. Without any pre-recorded sets, Freddy has the skills and the audacity to perform on the fly mixes of 100% original material tailored to his specific audience, mood, and venue each night, be it a theater in northern California, a club in the back alleys of Detroit, or an outdoor festival in the bush off the coast of Australia (occasionally on special nights with his live drummer(s) forming the FT Live Band/Duo). His earth shattering, meticulously programmed beats & rhythms; lazer crunk, funky psychedelic bass & sound design; and brain tingling, intelligently soul-soaked synths, melodies, & field-recorded samples are all sure to shake your consciousness silly as they blast through airwaves out of top notch sound systems across the universe while Freddy serenades you with 100% live & improvised get-your-booty-on-the-floor analog Moog synth and keytar, loop triggering, and percussive drum elements. It's weird out there, but it's also really fun, so definitely be very careful where you don't look.""

@SoDowns-secret-stash

To be SoDown is to seize every opportunity, explore new grounds and ultimately live the most epic life possible. This universe is far too beautiful and life is simply too short to not do what brings you happiness. Unconditional love is the most powerful force in the world and bass music is my way of expressing it.

 

As a part of the hungry Mile High Sound Movement SoDown has shared the stage with acts such as  Opiuo, Bassnectar, The Floozies, and more. A staple in the Colorado underground, SoDown has made a name for himself by gathering a dedicated fan base of supporters and friends. SoDown calls Boulder home, however his grasps reach far beyond the front range, playing such festivals as Sonic Bloom and Wakarusa. SoDown’s latest productions include his wide array of musical talents including sound design, saxophone, guitar, and piano. SoDown’s live set is not one to miss, featuring live saxophone and guitar, he weaves in and out of his many styles seamlessly. His music varies widely, ranging from soul soothing jazz, and blues, to hard funk, future bass and dubstep. SoDown is proving step by step to be one of the top and hardest working producers in the game.",5711,45,,,,,,8,Hello@ImSoDown.commagneticexperiences@gmail.com

BIOGRAFIE SASCH BBC english

Contrary to common belief Sascha Ries aka Sasch BBC is not a branch of british broadcasting, but nevertheless his name also stands for splendid entertainment. He delivers delicious music from Germany’s Rhein-Main-Area. Deep-seated in there are the roots of the current Loft resident, which shaped the mentality of his sound since the beginning.

In young years, Sascha was electrified by the precursors of today’s electronic scene like Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb. The desire for spinning records himself and encouraging a crowd to dance grew and was rewarded with his first residency in the age of 16 (1993) – in a time when pegging styles was not a common practice, when Techno was simply Techno and even House and Happy Breakbeats didn’t get in line. Around that time Sascha utilized an Amiga-computer to make his first steps in musical production. And for the people’s pleasure, a lot of tapes were mixed these days. Additional versatility was also proven by him in discjockey activities beyond his electronic paths. He put his mixing skills to work for the hip hop band “Noname Produkt” and released 2 CDs in collaboration wth them. But in spite of this detours his heart was always heavily beating in 4/4-steps – House and Techno. 

So in 2003 he came along the residency in the Loft Club Ludwigshafen, which remains true until today. And his impulsive sets were decisive for direct support of Sven Väth, Loco Dice, Ricardo Villalobos, Magda, Marco Carola, Richi Hawtin and many other top-class DJs. Sascha became iconic in the widely acclaimed Loft Club. Meanwhile in 2003, the event label “Envy My Music” offered him to take an additional residency in Frankfurt’s innovative Monza Club. He easily decided to do so. And by now he conquered almost all electronic clubs around the Rhein-Main-Area. On top of this his career has been elevated by playing sets at Time Warp 07 to 12! “Music has to be fun” isn’t only his often repeated mantra, it’s also a quality receptible in his sets. Heavily affected by the locally specific minimalistic Deephouse sound, he spreads his music up to groovy and funky House, Techhouse, Indie Dance and 80’s Synth Pop – but always with a certain element of high temper. Dark and blut just simply never was his thang. His music was realeased on such labels as 8 Bit, Great Stuff, Plastic City, Brise, Noir, Sleazy Deep, Sintope, Cimelde and Viva Music....",5502,76,https://www.facebook.com/saschbbc1,https://www.facebook.com/saschbbc1,https://twitter.com/#!/SaschBBC,,"http://www.sasch-bbc.de

Born and raised in Kissimmee, FL Big Makk was introduced to the DJ scene at a very young age where he began to take up spinning records at the age of 13. From there it evolved into actually experimenting and learning to make hip-hop beats which evolved into what he is today.

Down the road he eventually teamed up with a group of like minded individuals and started a night called Shake N Bass which is still run to this day in Orlando, FL. This party was able to push a new sound and eventually cause national attention with blogs like THUMP writing an article about the party. From there Big Makk was able to take the sound and experience around Florida and eventually the country. 

On the music side of things his skill level and talent has resulted in releases on some of the most prominent labels in the music scene today including Main Course, Mad Decent, Dim Mak, T&A, Sol Selectas, and Slow Roast. His style of production can be heard across wide array of different genres with really no boundaries.

Kungs (pronounced « Koongs ») is a 19 years old producer from the south of France. He started his musical career with a djembe gifted by his parents to him at the age of five. From these early days Valentin could spend entire afternoons listening to Rock’n’Roll classics with his father. From The Who to The Kooks with many in-between, this essential listening forged the first steps to Kungs inspiration as an artist. 

Discovering a passion for electronic music in his teenaged years, Kungs became infused with interest for melodic sounds and crafted timbres always lead by a dominant vocal. By the age of seventeen his interests had evolved, and creating melodies using his own instruments became a passion. 

Shortly after his first experiences with a digital production software, Valentin was sharing remixes across the board of online social networks. His remix of Bob Marley - ‘Jammin’ and Lana Del Rey ft Molly - ‘West Coast’ both boast several million plays on Soundcloud & YouTube.  


After a few unofficial remixes, official remixes requests were around the corner. From Axwell & Ingrosso to Lost Frequencies, Kungs quickly became a key remixer for the other DJ producers. Kungs’s remix of « Are you with me » counts now more than 16 million views on Youtube and more than 65.000 fans are following his Soundcloud page.

Simoultaneously, his first original track “To Describe You” became available.
This collaboration with Mozambo featuring Molly instantaneously hit one million plays on Soundcloud. 

With early support slots with significant acts from many aspects of the melodic house landscape such as Kygo and Klingande, Kungs has quickly formed into a well established artist in the scene today with a tendency to provide driven and impressive production and live sets. 

In January 2016, Kungs traveled the European continent alongside David Guetta in order to ensure seven times the warm-up of his Listen Tour.

On February 16th, Kungs released his new single "" This Girl "" melting the soul voice of the Australian band Cookin' On 3 Burners with his powerful hooks. Only a week after the release, ""This Girl"" was already charting all around Europe and keep growing every day.
Other original tracks are around the corner so you better stay tuned.",68964,51,https://www.facebook.com/Kungsmusic,https://www.facebook.com/Kungsmusic,https://twitter.com/kungsmusic,,,10,quentin@unitygroup.frquentin@unitygroup.frjazz.spinder@caa.comlaura.newton@caa.com

RUFF ÐR∆FT,Creative,Alpha Pup Records Rootnote Collective,http://soundcloud.com/ruff-draft,RUFFDRAFTMUZIK@GMAIL.COM,"(Brandon Ruffin), known as Ruff Draft, in the post ambient, tech industrial era of music is an imposing, experimental producer from San Francisco, California. Musical blood ties to artist David Ruffin of the (Temptations) may explain the sometimes soulful play between harmony and discord in the collage like dissonance that is Ruffin’s music.

Ruff Draft, with a firm foundation in Nu-Jazz, Soul, and Hip-Hop, has released several projects which set you onto a Plutonian adventure of melodic chimes and space traffic, Draft bends ambiance music into Jazzy improvisation like sweet and sour, hard candy in tracks that follow lines that resemble hump-back arches.

A strong representative of the Oakland Electronic/Experimental scene, Ruff Draft is a resident musician at  San Francisco's (RESONATE) and Founder of the rising (ROOTNOTE COLLECTIVE)and member of the (ALPHA PUP RECORDS) roster. Ruff Draft shares collective input and his a member of the following collectives (Potholes Music, Modern Filth, 10Thirty Records, and ELLT). Ruff Draft has gained the ears and respect by those who nod there heads to the journey of his space jazz vibes--RuffDraft keeps it no secret that his sound is highly influenced by the instrumental magician of sound Flying Lotus. But make no mistakes about Ruff-Draft's sound, though production influences such as Flying Lotus, J-Dilla, and MF Doom, can be heard in RuffDraft's melodies, his compositions live in a space all of their own.

""Im so highly influenced by FlyLo, Dilla, Doom, Pete Rock, and so many other great producers that one of the more difficult things at times is really pulling back--getting space from the track, and making sure that the songs I write have a true identity of their own--I just make music that I would listen to.""

Ruff Draft has shared the stage with the likes of Mono/Poly (Brainfeeder), Odd Nosdam (Anticon), Dibia$e(10Thirty), Eprom(Rwina), Inightful (Soulection), Jonwayne (Stones Throw) several member of the infamous (TeamSupreme) and many other notable and talented musicians. His live performances are blissfully intoxicating experiences that intertwine galactic tones and tribal patterns which provide a cadence for the soul. Ruff Draft has shared his live experience with crowds at (Low End Theory LA), (Beat Cinema LA), (Bear Trap SF), (Resonate SF), (Beat Church SF).

Step into his dimension, breath in the atmosphere that shrouds his planet, let his melodies and spacey deep baselines fill your lungs, and prepare to be under the influence of his delightfully addictive sound.

ILLENIUM (Official),Creative,Nicholas Miller,http://soundcloud.com/illeniumofficial,ha@illenium.com,"There are melodic bass producers, and then there is Nick Miller. The Denver-based producer known as Illenium has been turning heads in the dance music community over the past year and for good reason. Illenium has distinguished himself from the myriad of others through an unrivaled ability to create an immersive emotional experience of highs and lows that pulls on the heart strings and leaves the listener awestruck, accomplishing in the span of just a few short minutes what takes many a full set. He has displayed an adeptness for creating aural arrangements that vary in style, yet always maintain beauty, complexity and emotional depth. Illenium gave the world a taste of what he has to offer in 2014 with standout originals “Falling In,” “So Wrong,” “Make Me Do;” remixes of Dawn Golden, Odesza, Oh Wonder; and performances at Global Dance Festival, Decadence NYE and other select dates. However, as foreshadowed by his inclusion in UKF’s “Ones to Watch: 15 for 2015,” this is poised to be Illenium’s breakout year.

The Legend...

Witnessing the destruction his family had caused as the first to be infected, Apashe confronted them. There was no escaping their wrath, and so, amidst the madness in the household, Apashe reached for his grandfather’s tomahawk.  As he ferociously swung the ancient weapon at the savages, Apashe knew the flesh he cut into repeatedly was that of his own blood; his own family.  Fighting for his life, Apashe’s mind spun and anger rushed through his shaking body.  In a final spit of rage and lunacy Apashe managed to behead the last attacker; his father. Horrified and drenched in sinew he stood among the mangled remains, blood flooding at his feet.  He had managed to escape their blood-thirsty urges.  As he reached for the front door, he glanced back one last time at his dismembered family.  His father lay closest, and reaching down and taking a two-feather necklace from his father’s headless body, he made a promise to avenge whoever was responsible...

Residing in the Netherlands, Jonathan Tan AKA Wantigga, has been making beats in his hometown Deventer since he was a boy. Growing up in a churchgoing household, he was raised with lots of gospel, soul and jazz music. As an autodidact, he taught himself to play several instruments, but his interest turned quickly to electronic music and hiphop.

Bio:
A native of Tokyo, Japan and now resident of Los Angeles, California - starRo, the rising sun whose story permeates much farther than the music he makes, but rather an embodiment of sacrifice, persistence and passion, is now solidified as one of Soulection's wisest, and most experienced music makers. starRo makes soulful electronic music, period. And he makes it with the utmost diligence and craftiness that requires listeners to participate with absolute, undivided attention. Listeners in end, leave the journey mystified and elevated to a sultrier state. 
starRo's musical maturity and ability to captivate an audience of world wide music lovers comes second to none, and inspires many of his Soulection label mates in their music making processes. Having toured the United States, Canada and throughout Asia, playing alongside artists like Flume, Chet Faker, Gold Link, Giraffage, starRo pulls his creative inspiration from not only eclectic artists like Stevie Wonder, Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Neptunes, Sly Stone, J Dilla and Bill Evans, but also the visual arts, architecture and nature, his father and all sushi chefs from around the globe. 
Remnant of mid 90's R&B, paired with lush chords and atmospheric melodies as his forte, starRo's sound is now ready to be embraced by the larger international, electronic beat scene. After dropping a very successful, and passionate, Soulection White Label release in December 2013, generating over 240,000 plays in the first month, starRo's resonance has left everyone anticipating his forthcoming project in late 2014. 2014 will also see starRo showcasing w/ Soulection at SXSW in Austin, Texas in March, as well as an early April Asia tour through Japan and Korea with label brethren, ESTA and The Whooligan.",45500,52,http://www.facebook.com/starRoofficial,http://www.facebook.com/starRoofficial,http://twitter.com/starRo75,,,7,ahayes@icmpartners.commanagement@vibecoachindustries.com

SPANKALICIOUS

Psychedelic Bounce/Live Drums ( Cincinnati, Ohio )

ThazDope Records - Re:Evolution Media - Grassroots California

If you have followed the Electronic Music/Festival scene in the United States over the past few years, chances are you have heard the name Spankalicious come up in passing. He has shared the stage with nearly every cutting edge act in electronic music (Pretty Lights, Bassnectar, Eoto, Glitch Mob, Sphongle, Griz, Big Gigantic,Tipper, and many more), as well as performed at many of the nations premier music festivals (Wakarusa, SummerCamp, Camp Bisco, Counterpoint, Sonic Bloom, Arise, FarmFest, Infrasound, and Rootwire to name a few).

Spanky's presence has become demanded nationwide and continues to rise with the launch of his Cincinnati based record label,ThazDope Records.

ThazDope launched on 4/20/2014 out in Denver, Colorado during the 5 year anniversary celebration of long time supporters Grassroots California. 

The label made major moves this summer by partnering up with GRC and the What the Dub Crew to bring the ThazDope Stage to both SummerCamp and Wakarusa. This staged hosted many amazing headlining acts as well as serving as a place for up and coming talent to show case their talents on a professional level sound system and lighting production.

The stage went over so well at Scamp and Waka, the crew decided to team up with Cincinnati's own Essential Productions to host the ThazDope Stage at Ohio's Resonance Music Festival! Resonance serves as the kickoff to the ThazDope Records SpOILed Nation Tour where the label will be hosting global headlining acts such as Bluetech, Random Rab, Eskmo, Phutureprimative, Dessert Dwellers, Kaminanda, EarthCry, as well as showcasing the brand new audio/visual production that will be touring with the label this fall!

The second half of the tour will bring something new to the live show for Spank. He will be adding longtime friend Nick Werth aka: Galaxe to the production. The two joined forces on stage together this past July at the Rootwire Music Festival in West Virginia. The connection was made, and now the next chapter begins to unfold in the live aspect of the Spankalicious experience. Be sure to to catch Spanky in one of the 35 cities near you this Fall alongside label mates Alejo and Bass Coma for the SpOILed Nation Tour!

Throughout life’s journey we often encounter feelings, emotions, or circumstances that cannot be described in words. This is the goal that Pham, born Dawid Phan Ngoc, is looking to achieve when creating music.
 
Born and raised in Nysa, Poland, Pham began experimenting with music production at the age of 16, watching Youtube tutorials and countless hours of trial and error on FL Studio. Despite no formal music training, Pham’s love of the arts can be traced back to his interests in drawing and dancing, which have helped craft his vibe and sound today. With influences ranging from J Dilla, Flume, Flying Lotus, and Deadmau5, Pham began producing songs with strong melodic harmonies and compositions, hoping to create a supernatural experience through his music. 
 
Not to be boxed in to any genre, Pham’s musical style is meant to be a fusion of various elements, combining electronic, hip-hop, down-tempo, and future bass into the beautiful meld featured on the MOVEMENTS EP. The lead single “Movements”, has already amassed over 3 Million streams on Spotify and over 12 Million streams on Soundcloud. The MOVEMENTS EP features collaborations with various rappers and singers, with videos to be released over the coming weeks.

It is quite tragic that the greatest art
as a ruthless expression of a sensitive creative self
is almost inevitably linked to a kind of insecure self-centeredness
that makes it so difficult to be at ease with oneself and to really form
emotionally healthy connections with others
instead of the merely entertaining, yet superficial connections
of an adorning crowd

Whether on his own or alongside his Lords Of Fitness teammates, this German wunderkind turnablist-turned-producer has dominated the world of DJ battles since 2002, scoring more trophies and international titles than any of his competitors worldwide. 

After resigning from the battle circuit and moving from his hometown of Düsseldorf to Brooklyn, Rafik, the son of two classical musicians, decided to take it down a notch, and spend some quality time with his synths and machines. 

Besides being a frequent guest in clubs from Australia to China, Japan, and the UK, Rafik’s eclectic productions and remix work present a unique take on the electronica, hip hop and techno intersection.",6324,30,http://www.facebook.com/deejayrafik,http://www.facebook.com/deejayrafik,http://twitter.com/DJRAFIK,http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dj+rafik&aq=f,,9,tobias@g-w-a.comlabel@clarity-live.com

Shash'U is a Montreal producer, DJ and songwriter who has been active for the past ten years and has been associated with Piu Piu, the electro-beat movement. The artist, of Haitian descent, has a long track record as a DJ for street dance battles.  Shash'U has worked in the world of Hip-Hop, Pop and Electro Acoustics with an array of international artists such as James Di Salvio, Youssoupha (Fr), Kutmah (UK), Gage (Fr), Kaytranada (MTL) and Gilles Peterson (UK).  His EP and remixes available online, have earned him international recognition and invitations to some of the greatest DJ gatherings and festivals, including Boiler Room, Low End Theory, Piknik Electronic, Hit + Run and Igloofest. Shash’U describes his style as PWRFNK (Power Funk), a genre he made popular through the distinct character of his drums, the ubiquity of his bass and his melodies influenced by 70´s-80´s funk revisited with an urban / vintage-hip-hop /street beat flavour.


Shash’U est un DJ-auteur-compositeur-interprète montréalais actif depuis une dizaine d’années et associé au mouvement électro-beat Piu Piu. L’artiste d’origine haïtienne possède une longue feuille de route à titre de DJ et beat producer pour la danse de rue. Shash’U a collaboré avec une panoplie d’artistes internationaux dans le monde du hip-hop, de la pop et de l’électro dont James DiSalvio, Youssoupha (Fr), Kutmah (UK), Gage (Fr), Kaytranada (MTL) et Gilles Peterson (UK). Ses remix et EP offerts gratuitement en ligne lui ont valu une renommée internationale et des invitations à  certains grands rassemblements de DJ et festivals dont le Boiler Room, Low End Theory, Piknik Electronic, Hit + Run et Igloofest. Son style est qualifié de PWRFNK (Power Funk), un genre qu’il popularise grâce au mordant de ses batteries, l’omniprésence de ses basses et ses mélodies influencées par le funk des années 70-80 qu’il revisite avec une saveur urbaine/hip-hop-vintage/street beat.

chad@spinartistagency.com

MANAGEMENT: 
evan@hthqgroup.com

Bleep Bloop’s musical world is one of stripped back, bass-heavy beats paired with stark,surreal soundscapes. Aggressive and off the wall sounds weave in and out of heavy drums as he blends genre’s into a low frequency style that works as well at a festival as it does in your headphones.

Bleep Bloop has earned the support of distinguished artists such as DJ Shadow, Noisia, 12th Planet,DJ Craze, Kode9, Boyz Noize, Minnesota, Herobust, and G Jones, to name just a few. He has performed at sold out shows in flagship venues across the country alongside DJ Shadow,Cashmere Cat as well as Low End Theory (LA). His music has been broadcast on BBC Radio1, Diplo and Friends, Rinse FM, and on every continent except for antarctica (maybe).

“Angular, brutal and barbed with a bass tongue that tickles with both a west coast and UK twang, it’s the sound Bleep Bloop has been cooking since he was first baptized by bass” -Dave Jenkins, UKF

Bass Astronaut/Dream Engineer
Owner @the-dream-vault

Luzcid's music is a sonic odyssey. A series of auditory adventures in which the participants completely escape time and space. He meticulously eludes genres in order to welcome a variety of enthusiasts to gather and celebrate the rewards of community. Luzcid hopes music can become platform in which the peoples of the world can reconnect and begin to restore our home to a place in which we all enjoy living.

He has already performed in almost every major US city and continues to spread his wings across the music community.Although his production stands proudly on its own ,Luzcid has proven he is one of those acts you need to experience live to get the full picture. He uses ableton live to weld a sonic quilt of sensationally hefty hip-hoppy psychedelic bass music. 

His song with Bassnectar ""Science Fiction"" is a splendid illustration of Luzcid's ability to collaborate and conceive a fierce beauty with one of EDM's most revered artists.",51564,117,http://www.facebook.com/LUZCIDMUSIC,http://www.facebook.com/LUZCIDMUSIC,http://twitter.com/luzcidmusic,http://youtube.com/luzcid,,2,Eric@Grvdncr.com

=========================================
Bio

The multi-dimensional producer/performer/DJ Anthony Traynor AKA PROPATINGZ is responsible for some of the finest moments in contemporary EDM. Heralded as “Man of the Moment” (Fat Drop UK) he has numerous top 10 releases on dubstep’s biggest labels (BOKA, Z Audio, Black Acre, Fabric, PLAY ME) and has emerged as one of the hottest names on the international DJ circuit. His production prowess has been in great demand for remix and collaboration projects for scene powerhouse producers such as 16 bit, Bassnectar and Breaks legend Freq Nasty with major support coming from N-type, Glitch Mob, Akira Kiteshi and Radio 1 DJ Kissy Sell Out amongst others. In his previous incarnation as “BreakBeatBuddha” he helped forge the now lauded International Glitch Hop scene alongside such artists as Edit and Lazer Sword.

2009 saw the first PropaTingz releases, the first of which, “Peacemaker”, made it on to the seminal Fabric Live mix CD, mixed by Freq Nasty. “Babylons Scared ft Dakini” (Audio Freaks) followed close behind with the mighty 16 bit on remix duties, described by Boomkat as “a technological murder weapon”; In 2010 the pace quickened as Propa took turns on the remix duties remixing 16 bits slaughter house dubstep anthem “Chainsaw Calligraphy” (BOKA). His crunk step take on the original, described by ST Holdings as “devastating, pure and simple” earned him accolades and established him as a major player in genre. “PoorManStyle/Wickedest Sound” (Off Road/Black acre) found its way to Kissy Sell Outs “Young Blood” feature on BBC Radio 1 and was an instant dubstep rave smash. “Hustle Hard/Stay Alive” (Bad Acid/Black Acre) saw Propa return to his UK grime roots and was described by the listening booth as “a leviathan of block rocking bass science...”. 2010 saw Propa on remix duties for Rob Sparx in the form of ""Windscreen Snipa"" which found its way onto the seminal UKF dubstep channel on you-tube earning him close to a million hits just off this track alone. Through the various twists and turns of the scene Propa has managed to stay one step ahead of the curve and his last release ""STRONG"" on PLAY ME records did not disappoint. Feeling like the scene was becoming stale and generic he threaded elements of live musicality into the dancefloor formula to create an anthemic dubstep masterpiece. This effort won him a top 10 ranking on soundcloud overall as well as charting top 10 on Beatport. To back up this release Propa joined forces with the mighty Jesse Leach of KILL SWITCH ENGAGE to remix ""AWAKEN"" which was a metal-dubstep tour de force to be reckoned with.

2013 will see Anthony raising the bar in the form of the “PRECOGNITION” project, his first foray into Live territory. The Precognition Project integrates his full throttle dance floor sensibility with Live visuals and a rotating cast of outstanding musicians and performers. Stay close for the first releases coming soon!

Multiplier is more than just a DJ. He’s a big personality with hands in all corners of the music industry. Some days he’ll be headlining shows or running his label, other days you might find him producing chart topping sample packs or making YouTube videos for his 24,000 subscribers.

He started producing in early 2011, and within a few years reached #8 on the overall Beatport chart, and hit a million views on YouTube.

Multiplier’s comedic approach and lack of pretence is a breath of fresh air. This approach has not only created deep, personal connections with his audience, but it’s also garnered support from platforms like Beatport, Loopmasters, DJTechTools, iZotope, and EDM.com.

He has received support from and played alongside influential DJs including: Electrixx, High Rankin, Heartbreak, Le Castle Vania, Calvertron, Crizzly, Keith Shocklee (Public Enemy), Nerd Rage, Dani Deahl, SaBBo, and Kev Willow.

All inquiries: TKDOESWERK@gmail.com

In 2012, Tk was both signed to Paper Diamond’s label Elm & Oak and LA beat crew, TeamSupreme. Shortly after, he produced the hit single “Werkin’ Girls” for Angel Haze which was released through Universal/Motown & Island Records UK. In 2013, he began working with and released an EP with Grammy nominated producer, KE on the Track and also formed a tribal-edm project called @LIONKNGS with fellow Team Supreme member, @KingHenry. Tk's sound can be described as high energy club music with Dirty South 808’s melded with titillating, hyper-sexual melodic elements. 

Tk Kayembe's music has been featured in mixes by the likes of Baauer, Djemba Djemba, Ryan Hemsworth, Purity Ring, Paper Diamond, Plastician, Hoodboi, Falcons and Jack Beats. He has also shared the stage with phenomenal artists such as Salva, Ryan Hemsworth, Two Fresh, Giraffage and Black Star, and has played major festivals such as Coachella, Electric Forest, Tinderbox, River Beats, and more.",5943,86,http://www.facebook.com/tkdoeswerk,http://www.facebook.com/tkdoeswerk,http://twitter.com/tkdoeswerk,http://youtube.com/beatteamsupreme,"http://tkdoeswerk.com

LaOradj,Creative,LaOra,http://soundcloud.com/laoradj,stefanlaura@ymail.com,"          The Bucharest native has been Djing since 2009, and first sharpened her Dj skills in the city’s club scene during her recidency  for the clubs and pubs in the Old City and beaches at the Black Sea . On some level, almost all artists are storytellers, but LaOra’s ability to spin a compelling tale using nothing but music created by other people is what  gives her the ability to keep the dancefloor pomped up all over the country from club to club as a headliner starting from 2010 till today. 
          Even as her profile has risen dramatically in recent years, she  hasn’t dipped her toes into the production realm till 2014, LaOra’s focus being entirely on Djing.  In June 2014 LaOra’s making herofficial debut as a producer on natural Rhythm Label with the Ep called “UseMe”  inlc. Remixes from Dj Le Roi, Elio Riso & Chris Von Nuchaku.  Her passion for music  continues to evolve and in 2015 she’s back in the studio producing a new Ep in collab with Viorel Dragu, a collab that unites a commitment to vibrant melodic  vibes, classic drum-machines rhythms and techno bits. 
          Growing up in Romania, LaOra has always been inspired by hip-hop and electronic music, but over the years she’s also developed an impeccable ear for tech house and techno making an appearance on her dj sets with tribal influences , LaOra ensures that things never sound stable by periodically changing up the mood .  Besides  Romania she played in Ibiza, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Jordan and Bahrain.

Hailing from El Bolsón, a valley town in Argentina surrounded by towering mountain ranges, 23 year old producer Dabow is anything but ordinary. He lives with his family in a Yoga Center where he engages in daily meditation and spends his down time performing Indian mantras, singing, or playing the guitar and tablas. However, when day turns to night, Dabow shifts gears to create powerful electronic rhythms that rival even the most technical and expressive producers in the circuit. A master of both explosive energy and intricate, melodic artistry, he stands as a shining representative of the often overlooked South American beat-making community. Ever since his freshman EP, “Changes,” was released in October of 2014, Dabow has seen a rapid and exhilarating rise to recognition, working alongside such bodies as Mad Decent, Nest HQ, and Play It Louder. His endless catalogue of collaborations, remixes, and original EPs has also earned him ongoing support from Flosstradamus, What So Not, Troyboi, Djemba Djemba, Sam Gellaitry, Ozzie, G Jones and many more. With his toe dipped in seemingly every pool of producers, the mention of Dabow’s name now brings with it a knowing smirk and frantic scramble for the AUX cord. As 2016 approaches, and as Dabow continues to refine and explore his own production, his loyal and growing network of support and fandom wait eagerly for whatever comes next.",27654,42,https://www.facebook.com/dabowmusic,https://www.facebook.com/dabowmusic,https://twitter.com/dabowmusic,,,9,perry@unrivaledmgmt.com

(incl. Das Kapital & Do Work Records)

Bio:

Talk about Dance Music in South Africa and before long you’ll be discussing Das Kapital, his label Do Work Records, his two national radio shows, and his work ethic as a DJ, Artist, Producer and Remixer.

As one of the biggest DJs in South Africa, Das Kapital headlines both festivals and club nights across the country bringing a party vibe allied with his excellent technical skills.

He is known for the brilliance of his DJ sets and an ability to read a crowd to whom he transmits the infectious energy of his performances.

This talent has been demonstrated at headline sets at both Zimbabwe and UK festivals as he takes his skills international with great results. 

He is also one of the only DJs to have played legendary festival Oppikoppi three years in a row, has headlined Rocking The Daisies, Grietfest, Sonar Cape Town, Mad Decent Block Party and Ultra South Africa.

Das Kapital has been a fixture on Thursday nights on South Africa’s biggest national youth broadcaster 5FM via his popular In Das We Trust segment for the last year, where he brings the most upfront tracks from around the world to a growing base of fans, where he breaks down musical barriers and introduces new sounds every week.

This adds to his weekly two hour Das Kapital Radio Show on Assembly Radio that hosted exclusive DJ mixes from Tiesto, Nicky Romero, Cedric Gervais, Maya Jane Coles, Dismantle, Koan Sound, Prok & Fitch, DJ Cable, DJ Rafik, and Mumbai Science. 

Das Kapital’s remix of Corderoy ‘Dark Disco’ hit the Top 10 of the UK’s Buzz Chart in December 2014 and the two are collaborating on the future release Slap Head. 

This single will follow up remixes for Stoltenhoff and Mike Cervello’s Guerilla (Rimbu) and All Guns Blazing, Sharkslayer and First Gift’s Sergeant Africa on Top Billin’. 

Previous Das Kapital solo singles have been called the “Hottest Track in South Africa” and have also been playlisted by 5FM, YFM, Good Hope and Metro FM. 

Other remixes have been completed for Bronze Whale’s “Say It” on Waxhole USA, Ivan Gough & Feenixpawl feat Christine Hoberg “Hear Me” on Neon Records Australia and Royal K feat Lakota Silva’s “Love War” on F! Records / Soul Candi. 

He has also written music for Hollywood film trailers and USA TV shows as well as for a number of brand campaigns. 

As owner of Do Work Records he has been heavily involved in bringing through the next generation of South African electronic talent where the label will shortly release it’s eighth single. 

Artists include Leechi, Hendrik Joerges, RVWR and D.Know. 

In 2014 Das Kapital was named as one of GQ Magazine South Africa’s 35 Coolest People Under 35 and was also made one of the Mail & Guardian’s prestigious Top 200 Young South Africans; he has also contributed as a speaker to TEDxUCT in Cape Town and appeared on national TV in South Africa. 

He is also a brand ambassador for Puma, Roland SA, and RayBan.

In March 2014 Das Kapital also made headlines in South Africa when he launched the Kyle Brinkmann Breast Cancer Survivor Project in response to a chain of bars’ plastic surgery competition. 

Partnering with PinkDrive he has raised over R25, 000 with support from national press and national radio.  ",7865,95,http://facebook.com/iamDasKapital,http://facebook.com/iamDasKapital,http://twitter.com/iamDasKapital,http://www.youtube.com/user/DasKapitalDisco,"http://eepurl.com/v_tJL

Marian Hill is Jeremy Lloyd (production/songwriting) and Samantha Gongol (vocals/songwriting), an electronic duo producing songs that sound like a cross between Drake and Ella Fitzgerald, marrying bass-heavy, idiosyncratic beats and seductively soulful vocals.

The duo grew up together and their chance meeting in middle school, starring opposite each other in The Music Man as Marian Paroo and Harold Hill, now serves as the basis for their name. While pursuing separate musical paths, the two began writing together over college breaks, spending hours together perfecting lyrics and melodies —in the last of these sessions they wrote and recorded Whisky.

Jeremy blindly emailed Whisky to sixty blogs and within 2 weeks the track had climbed to the chart on Hype Machine. The buzz grew, the label calls began, and in early 2015 Marian Hill signed with Photo Finish / Republic Records.

“Got It”sees sexy vocals sail above early-Neptunes-era glitchy beats and handclaps before a melody transfixes, singing a mantra to individuality veiled in sly innuendo. The beat’s sparse backbone came to Jeremy on a bus ride home to Philadelphia for a writing session, and the song was completed by the end of the following day. On “One Time”finger-snaps and a bass boom keep time as Samantha’s voice casts a spell, twisting the old one-night stand into a song of female empowerment.

Their sound has just started to percolate throughout the zeitgeist at large, soundtracking numerous promotional campaigns, television shows, and packed nightclubs. Now prepping their debut full-length debut, they seek to push the limits of their content and sonics even further.

“We love the control you have in modern songwriting, because it’s not just music and lyrics - it’s everything. We’re writing an album of true, focused songs - where every component, from the choice of snare drum to the choice of lyric, is driven by one specific idea.”

MANAGEMENT: matt@kidding-aside.com


A seulement 19 ans, Marlin a déjà à son actif des remixes officiels pour Sebastien Tellier, Selah Sue ou Petite Meller.
Il fait partie de cette jeune generation de producteurs qui ont cassé les barrières entre l’electronique la plus pointue, le Hip-Hop mainstream ou la Nu-Disco.
 
Partagé pendant son adolescence entre la rigueur du conservatoire le jour et son goût pour les clubs la nuit, il apprend alors à jouer de tous les instruments à sa disposition et perfectionne sa technique de programmation et de mix.
Sa versatilité et son goût pour la pop lui ouvrent vite la voie de collaborations diverses, et bientôt Marlin côtoie et remixe ceux qu’il écoutait avec admiration quelques mois auparavant.
De mashup en mixes publiés sur Soundcloud, son profil grandit.
D’abord influencé par les pionniers de la french touch, il affine son style avec l'arrivée de la vague future beats. Ses productions sont aujourd'hui aussi bien remplies d’énergie hip hop que par des harmonies R&B/Funk/Soul.
 
Son premier EP ""EVERLASTING"" est à venir sur le label « Record Record »


19 years old Marlin has already produced official remixes for Sebastien Tellier, Selah Sue or Petite Meller.
He is part of this young generation of producers who broke down the boundaries between the most specialized electronic music, mainstream Hip-Hop or Nu-disco.
 
During his adolescence, shared between music academy's rigor in the day and his interest for clubs at night, he learned all the musical instruments that were at his disposal, and perfected his programming and mixing technique.

His versatility and his taste for pop music music brought him on the way towards various collabs, Marlin quickly gets to know and remix those He was listening to admiringly a few months before.

With mashups and mixes shared on the Soundcloud platform, his name gets bigger.
Initially influenced by the french touch pioneers, he refine his style under the Future Beats wave. His productions are now filled with Hip-Hop energies as well as R&B/Funk/Soul harmonies.

C-Ro [DJ/Producer],Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/c-ro_music,booking@globalstage.eu,"German:

Obwohl beide Künstler nur ein Bindestrich trennt, hat C-ro mit dem bekannten Pandamaskenrapper aus Stuttgart musikalisch nur wenig gemeinsam. Seit 2005 tourt C-ro alias Christopher Roos bereits durch die Clubs der Republik. Im Gepäck hat dabei Tracks aus den Bereichen Deep-, Vocal- und Techhouse.

Diverse eigene Produktionen verleihen seinen Sets zudem eine individuelle Note. Sein Remix zu Asaf Avidans „Maybe you are“ erreichte auf YouTube mehrere Millionen Klicks und füllt die Tanzflächen weit über die deutschen Landesgrenzen hinaus. Seine erste offizielle Single „Rollin‘ Flies“ veröffentlichte er auf dem Kölner Label „WePlay“ im Juni 2013. Zudem steuerte gemeinsam mit Sofa Tunes einen Remix für das Album des kanadischen Popduos „Tegan & Sara“ auf „Warner Music“ bei.

Neben diversen Gigs in Österreich und Deutschland bespielte er bereits große Festivals wie die „Ruhr in Love 2012“, das „Sputnik Spring Break 2013“ oder das „SonneMondSterne – Festival 2013“.

English:

Although Cro and C-ro can only be distinguished by a hyphen, both artists do not have much in common. Since 2005 Christopher Roos aka C-ro tours through diverse clubs in Germany. His style includes a different selection of tracks from deep-, tech- and melodic vocal house.

One of his productions, a bootleg of Asaf Avidan’s track “Maybe you are” has already reached some million views on YouTube and fascinates the crowd on the dance floor. His first own single “Rollin’ Flies” has been released on the label “WePlay” in June 2013. Furthermore, he already did a remix together with Sofa Tunes for the album of the Canadian pop duo “Tegan & Sara” on “Warner Music”.

Besides many gigs in Germany and Austria, he also played at big festivals such as “Ruhr in Love 2012”, “Sputnik Spring Break 2013” and “SonneMondSterne-Festival 2013”.

Biography:
Reaching more than one million of clicks per month just on Soundcloud, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko attain massive stats for an underground artist. It must say that the Belgium duet didn't steal this success! From their recent remixes to the first appearance on Tiefblau with “Drop it Like it’s Hot, the duet sail between a Nu-Disco, Deep-House dance-floor oriented to a Melodic or Tropical House music, as a journey. Like this summer 2012 in Ibiza where Vijay & Sofia decided to create this duo.
As a couple, in life and behind the decks, Vijay & Sofia, they lead the discussion on social network and on the dance-floors since 2 years, but the career of Vijay started well before, with collaborations as the like of Camilo Franco Nico Pusch or Rodriguez Jr. Without forgetting the past, Vijay open the doors to the duet at the end of 2012.
An artist can share his life only with another artist, and that's why the duo works so well. Sofia has the soul of an artist that sticks to the skin. A well-chosen word for a tattoo artist. This graphic artist with a strong universe is also a huge fan of music and dance (More than 12 years as dancer) and Vijay led him to be with him behind the decks and software productions.
The first success of Vijay & Sofia will come from some of these free Remixes and Edits available on Soundcloud for the followers. In two year, they will remixes artists like Asaf Avidan, Daft Punk, John Newman, Kiesza, Ben Howard, 2Pac, A$AP Rocky, Duke Dumont, Gabriel Rios, Buena Vista Social Club, Queen, Nicolas Jaar , and many more…. Proof of their talent, the label of Daft Punk contacted Vijay & Sofia to release their remix of Get Lucky on Columbia in Vinyl Edition.
Except the several free download offer to their fans, the releases on major nu-disco & deep imprints are coming on Warner Music, Tonspiel, Tigers Records, Delicious Recording, Sleazy Deep, Sleazy G, Street King, Tiefblau Records, Dear Deer, Spirit Soul Records, Future Allianz, Love Style, KiezBeats and others…, and reaching several time the best sales of Beatport.
Still an eye on the future, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko will release soon an official remix for Feder, Moby, The Disco Boys, Lexer, Nico Pusch and other surprises . And if the future of electronic music will be displayed with the belgian colors?:)

Once upon a time two crafty bandits met in the sacred street of Bali in Amsterdam. At that exact moment a 32TB external hard drive slid down a golden rainbow which magically appeared right in front of their feet, lucky them. The hard drive contained so many mysterious unreleased tracks that they never would have to produce themselves. Even though it sometimes seems like they are actually producing some tracks inside a studio, they fake it all. Jordi & Jan were hired as ghost artists so that people would think two pretty dutch guys were behind all of this. Nothing could be further from the truth. They call themselves Bali Bandits. Luckily for them, nobody reads biographies anyway..

During a career spanning just over a decade, house music DJ and producer Carl Hanaghan has well and truly lived the dream having travelled far and wide to headline the biggest festivals and nightclubs across the globe.

Hailing from Brighton, Carl was introduced to the house music scene in the early naughties where inspirational sets from the likes of Erick Morillo, Joey Negro, Masters At Work and Fatboy Slim would set the tone for Carl’s development as a DJ. Through his passion for uplifting feel good House music Carl firmly established himself as an official resident DJ for the International clubbing sensation Hed Kandi in 2006. Carl’s dynamic technical ability compliments his versatile DJ sets that include a sublime selection of the finest deep, soulful and vocal house music, old and new.

In the studio, Carl’s productions, collaborations and remixes have been heavily supported by the world’s biggest DJs. His music has been released by a selection of the scenes leading record labels including Roger Sanchez’s Stealth Records, Cr2, Sonny Fodera’s Beatdown, My Digital Enemy’s Zulu Records and Hed Kandi. From laidback sunshine grooves, percussive tribal beats and slamming disco, Carl’s discography has been heavily featured in the Beatport, Traxsource, DMC, Music Week and Cool Cuts music charts as well as hitting the radio frequencies on BBC Radio 1, Kiss and Capital amongst many other stations globally.

During the Summer of 2014 Carl produced a cover version of the classic Techno record “Strings Of Life” originally written by Derrick May & Michael James aka Rhythim Is Rhythim. The record became an instant hit as soon as Zane Lowe dropped it to a full house at BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend in Glasgow, which was shortly followed with support from Danny Howard on his Dance Anthems radio show.

Not only a DJ, Carl’s 24 hour 7 days a week lifestyle of working in the music industry over the past 10 years has seen him as an A&R for record labels such as the Ministry Of Sound, Cr2 and Hed Kandi. Since 2010 Carl compiles and mixes the much-loved Hed Kandi compilations, having sold over half a million albums worldwide.

With an uncontrollable passion for music, and a keen interest in the violin, it is no surprise that twenty-four year old Gostan is emerging as a huge talent in the electronic music scene. Recently signed to Universal Music Germany, this ardent French DJ/Producer is quickly proving that he has the potential to reach unprecedented heights.

The timing could not be better for Gostan - with his signature sound is swiftly on the rise and the musical tide shifting ever in his favour - this musical wunderkind who has been patiently waiting to cascade his melodies across the dance music scene is about to have his moment.

At the ripe young age of 6, his relationship with music blossomed when he started learning to formulate the basics in music making. In his teenage years, he decided to switch the violin for making electronic beats on Logic. It was then that Gostan honed in on creating and developing his unique blend, the kind of music that transports listeners to a place of pure happiness and bliss.

Alongside an outstanding talent for transforming existing songs into uplifting, light-hearted remixes; Gostan is a producer in the truest sense. Creating his own distinctive material with ease, he is determined to put the heart back into electronic dance music. In order to ensure he delivers stunning feel-good house music, he warms his songs with delicate melodies, slight brass percussion, and carefully selected vocals.

His first track ‘Aube’ blends African voices with tropical loops and electronic hooks, creating a track that is extremely difficult not to love. Gearing up for the release of his second track ‘Klanga’, Gostan takes us on a trip back in time, combining history with his new-house sound. He incorporates a sample of John F. Kennedy’s “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech from 1963 with an undeniably cheerful melody and beat. This powerful track reaches its climax as a round of applause is met with a thrilling burst of saxophone, paying a grand tribute to a ground-breaking moment in time.

He is the epitome of Parisian cool, yet possesses a universal style, which is gaining him fans all across the globe. Aspiring to follow in the footsteps of Eastern European EDM geniuses such as Klangkarussel and Bakermat, with stellar talent and great ambition, there is no doubt he will propel onto the forefront of the instrumental house music movement. With plenty more magical tricks up his sleeve, the future is looking bright for Gostan. With plans to incorporate violins into his tribal beats, and singing onto his instrumental choruses, the complexity in his masterful work is set to increase and add to his dreamy, empowering music. Get acquainted with his name, because Gostan is one that you will be hearing a lot more of in the near future.

Biography:
Reaching more than one million of clicks per month just on Soundcloud, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko attain massive stats for an underground artist. It must say that the Belgium duet didn't steal this success! From their recent remixes to the first appearance on Tiefblau with “Drop it Like it’s Hot, the duet sail between a Nu-Disco, Deep-House dance-floor oriented to a Melodic or Tropical House music, as a journey. Like this summer 2012 in Ibiza where Vijay & Sofia decided to create this duo.
As a couple, in life and behind the decks, Vijay & Sofia, they lead the discussion on social network and on the dance-floors since 2 years, but the career of Vijay started well before, with collaborations as the like of Camilo Franco Nico Pusch or Rodriguez Jr. Without forgetting the past, Vijay open the doors to the duet at the end of 2012.
An artist can share his life only with another artist, and that's why the duo works so well. Sofia has the soul of an artist that sticks to the skin. A well-chosen word for a tattoo artist. This graphic artist with a strong universe is also a huge fan of music and dance (More than 12 years as dancer) and Vijay led him to be with him behind the decks and software productions.
The first success of Vijay & Sofia will come from some of these free Remixes and Edits available on Soundcloud for the followers. In two year, they will remixes artists like Asaf Avidan, Daft Punk, John Newman, Kiesza, Ben Howard, 2Pac, A$AP Rocky, Duke Dumont, Gabriel Rios, Buena Vista Social Club, Queen, Nicolas Jaar , and many more…. Proof of their talent, the label of Daft Punk contacted Vijay & Sofia to release their remix of Get Lucky on Columbia in Vinyl Edition.
Except the several free download offer to their fans, the releases on major nu-disco & deep imprints are coming on Warner Music, Tonspiel, Tigers Records, Delicious Recording, Sleazy Deep, Sleazy G, Street King, Tiefblau Records, Dear Deer, Spirit Soul Records, Future Allianz, Love Style, KiezBeats and others…, and reaching several time the best sales of Beatport.
Still an eye on the future, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko will release soon an official remix for Feder, Moby, The Disco Boys, Lexer, Nico Pusch and other surprises . And if the future of electronic music will be displayed with the belgian colors?:)",24360,60,https://www.facebook.com/parallelbelgium,https://www.facebook.com/parallelbelgium,,,"https://play.spotify.com/user/1110713705

Matt Nash,Chill/Mainstream,Matt Nash,http://soundcloud.com/mattnashmusic,jos@dedicatedbookings.nl,"Energy and persistence conquers all things. That has certainly been the case with the UK’s Matt Nash, a DJ and producer whose passion and determination have enabled him to rise from his local London scene to forge his own space amongst the global landscape of electronic music.
 
Deeply immersed in London’s thriving and diverse music scene from the age of fifteen, Matt has grown exponentially as an artist over the subsequent years. Self-assured and full of drive from the very start, he applied a keen ear and thirst for self-development to those around him in order to grow and mature as both a DJ and producer. This hard work has spawned an artist who today, now based in Amsterdam, is both a standout DJ and highly adept producer. Whilst behind the decks in a club, Nash is a natural performer who utilizes encyclopaedic knowledge of house to strengthen an already innate connection with his dancefloors and light up the atmosphere at places like the Revealed stage at Creamfields and Ushuaia in Ibiza. As a producer, he combines a remarkable ear for melody with an instinctive ability to infuse his music with energy, personality and attitude.
 
His tracks made fast inroads into electronic music culture courtesy of releases on a plethora of dance music mainstays, from Axwell’s Axtone to Hardwell’s Revealed. Probing the tips of the big room, electro and progressive house trends but keeping the roots solid, he has enticed fellow DJ’s and genre specific fans. Highlights so far include a track on Tiesto’s album, ‘Starlight’ with Don Diablo released on Axtone and ‘Till The End’ featuring Tara McDonald on Marcus Schossows’ label Code Red. ‘Fire Higher' with Sebjak featuring Eric Turner came on Ultra with the premiere on Proximity receiving over 150k plays in 48 hours.
 
Added to that, further success looks to follow for Nash with a track finished with AN21 coming on Size Records and currently being hammered by Steve Angello, plus 'Heartbeats' coming on Kryders ‘Sosumi’ label which has been getting played and supported by the likes of Steve Angello, Kryder, Tom Staar to name a select few.
 
With a smooth approach to the sound he delivers, the house music advocate is in a league of his own, dominating one beat to the next. The coming days are your cue to tune into the electric Matt Nash noise.

Alluring stages and soaring charts, from Italy to wherever the electronic music passport takes him, Luca Testa has been a premier candidate for recognized global talent.

On Beatport ‘Guzs’ hailed at 18 overall, ‘People Are You Ready’ claimed 35 on the electro house chart while ‘Keep On Rockin’ took 55 and ‘Bender’ at 65 on the progressive house ranking. Stepping back in time, Luca’s initial release ‘Get Away’ really got the attention his future road was promising, with 5 spot on the Trackitdown overall chart. Play and support for his records has come far and wide with drops from Hardwell, Afrojack, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Steve Aoki, Nervo, Zedd and Bingo Players at the inaugural EDC Las Vegas and many more, while a notable mention of his bootleg of Tiesto’s ‘Red Light’ was instant on Danny Howard’s show via BBC Radio 1.
The past year has kicked off flawlessly with appearances in the best festivals of Italy like Reload, Holi, Global and Imagine Music Festivals alongside DVBBS, Nervo, R3hab, Tony Junior, W&W and many many more.

Italy


Rayven & Valexx is a DJ duo consisting of two members, Ruben and Valerio. Sharing not only a passion for (house) music, but also their Italian roots, Ruben and Valerio quickly became friends and started producing together.
The Rayven & Valexx sound is inspired by Afro Latin, Funky Disco Groove, but most importantly their music is full of melancholic melodies and energy!
Artists that have influenced them the most are Erick Morillo, Eric Prydz, Daft Punk, Swedish House Mafia, and many others.
Throughout the last year, their releases on Fedde Le Grand’s Flamingo, Armada, Mutants Records gained lots of support by big names, such as Dada Life, David Guetta, Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, Oliver Heldens, Don Diablo and they even collaborated with Michael Brun on a track called ‘Vintage’, released on Kid Coconut.
The expectations for the future are high, and so it their aim!

Erba / Lars Näpflin (18 Years old) & Leandro Danson / Marco Hübner (21 Years old) 

Lars and Marco met in 2010 for the very first time. They started to produce electronic music and immediately found their passion for it. The two musicians decided to combine their talents and established their duo called „Level UP Brothers“ in 2013. The Brothers constantly tried to produce new genres until they found out that Bounce was their favourite. As they extended their know-how, they recognized that they wanted to produce their very own style. On NYE 2013 they had their first international gig in Italy. Since then they played in countries as Belgium, Germany, Scotland and of course Switzerland. They always managed to concentrate on both, their music career and private education. Until 2016 they released all their music for free. In the near future, they hope to sign more tracks to record labels.",22956,29,https://www.facebook.com/levelupbrothers,https://www.facebook.com/levelupbrothers,http://twitter.com/levelupbrothers,http://www.youtube.com/,"http://www.levelupbrothers.com

Easily recognised by his trademark thick framed glasses, Hey Sam has immersed himself in many aspects of the music industry as a DJ / Producer and Record Label Owner (Jump To This).

Described by US tastemaker blog ‘Gotta Dance Dirty’ as ‘doing G-House like no one else at the moment’ the hard working entrepreneur spends most of his time travelling the country throwing down his unique brand of bass heavy house music, all as part of the infamous LTM Crew.

In 2010, Sam gave birth to record label Jump To This, in partnership with Torren Foot the two continue to guide the label through a multitude of accolades including a string of Aria Chart and Beatport Chart nods.

Wearing his producer cap, Hey Sam’s ‘The Roof Off’ with Wildfire, reached number 3 on the Indie Dance/Nu-Disco Beatport Chart, then the solo follow up ‘Takes Time’ reached number 17 on the Aria Club chart leading to Sam’s first Australian headline tour.

Over the last 12 months Sam has dropped official remixes for Grammy award winning Roger Sanchez’s Stealth Records, Uprise Music, Ministry of Sound, Onelove and Vicious Bitch, combined with a spade of bootlegs which has seen him clock up over half a million Soundcloud plays, many Triple J Radio spins and DJ support from the likes of Destructo, Wax Motif, Motez, Shiba San, Torren Foot, Dom Dolla and Kyle Watson.

Metaphorically speaking Hey Sam’s vision has never been clearer and with a wave of momentum at his back, he is set to propel through 2016.

DJ Antoine,Chill/Mainstream,Antoine Konrad,http://soundcloud.com/djantoineofficial,matthias@mak-management.com,"With the biggest European hit of the year 2011 #WelcomeToStTropez, and the unbelievable over 1'000'000 times sold and Impala awarded hit single #MaCherie DJ Antoine launched himself to an international level. As expansion to his successful artistic career he will be starred on RTL, one of the most important German private networks, in January 2015. He’s sitting next to Dieter Bohlen, Heino and Mandy Capristo in the jury of ""Deutschland sucht den Superstar"" (cf. American Idol) and assesses the candidates with his experience as producer.

But the life of Europe’s most booked star-DJ and most successful Swiss export didn’t start with just glamour and fame. Antoine Konrad’s huge passion for music, endurance, commitment and his confidence in the things he believed in, have always been loyal companions on his way to the top. Also his flair for trends, the right partners, a strong team and of course his fans provided him with the support needed.

The beginning of DJ Antoine’s career is due to the establishment of the club “House Café” in Basel in 1995. Within a short period of time, his funky sets and his trademark “dress to impress” made him a cult figure within the Basel society and later on also in the Swiss House scene. In 1998 he produced his first album “DJ Antoine – The Pumpin House Mix”. The big breakthrough in Switzerland happened one year later, the “Houseworks 1” – Compilation was the first gold rewarded album of DJ Antoine. This success was followed by further compilations, albums and Gold-Awards. The single #ThisTime (2007) was his first international breakthrough and established DJ Antoine throughout the world.
	
After several intense months recording time in studio together with his partner Mad Mark, DJ Antoine’s last album ""2014 We Are The Party"" appeared in Summer 2014. The album contains many varied and atmospheric loaded songs and invites to boisterous party nights. In addition, the new single #GoWithYourHeart"" has been released simultaneously. DJ Antoine and Mad Mark have worked with two great artists together: Rapper #Euro from the American cult group #YoungMoney and singer #TemaraMelek, a new, exciting talent from Los Angeles.

""Steadily and patiently rising into light is Admin a.k.a Adam Wickens. 

Adam DJs and produces under the alias Admin, a name he adopted after admittedly spending too many hours staring at his PC start up screen. Since migrating to Bristol, he has become a valuable member of the city's infamous underground scene, making regular DJ appearances at recognised parties across Bristol steadily asserting himself as a must-see name on each local line-up he graces.

In what we can characterise as a truly impatient and disposable era that we now live in, Admin is a refreshing reminder that we can still build a path in music at our own pace.""

With solid groundwork and having honed his skills as a producer in his chosen home of Zurich, Patrick is set to release his first ever EP (“Five Dollar Play”) with the Anglo-Iberian label sinnmusik*.

As Patrick is an open minded person with vivid inspiration, he doesn’t want to be pegged down to one style. His sound is the result of different genres that have influenced him throughout the years with a twist of his own quality and passion.

Not only has eSenTRIK racked up millions of plays with his future-R&B solo work, but he’s proven to be equally skilled at crafting booty shaking anthems as one half of @TWRK. Called a “top notch remixer” by OkayFuture.com, his vibed out reworks of 90s and current hip-hop tracks have been supported by many of his peers including Diplo, GTA, DJ Snake, Skrillex, and Major Lazer. eSenTRIK is already no stranger to receiving airplay on BBC Radio 1 and SiriusXM, so expect his upcoming solo project to be in steady rotation in 2016.

It's not everyday a producer/DJ gets blogged by one of their favorite directors as is the case with Bobby C Sound TV who was recently blogged and called brilliant by Edgar Wright, director of such cult movies as Shaun Of The Dead, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World and Hot Fuzz (check it right here www.edgarwrighthere.com/2011/05/26/ba…und-tv-remix/ ). If that wasn't enough, Bobby also got a shout out by the Godfather of hip-hop, Afrika Bambaataa on a remix for Ft. Knox Recordings. And Krafty Kuts recently called him, ""the master of funky breaks"". Bobby C Sound TV is one Bobby Collins hailing from Denver, Colorado. He has been DJing for the 13 years and producing music for the past 10. In early 2009 Bobby started messing around with a video DJ plug-in and soon after unveiled, ""Bobby C Sound TV"". His love of cinema was combined with his years of DJ experience to create a pastiche of pop-culture that is visually stimulating and danceable at the same time. His live mash up DJ approach was applied to create crowd rocking routines with some of the most memorable music videos, movie scenes and just about everything in between.  
His approach to music and upbeat personality have helped him create a distinctive, signature sound that focuses on eclectic influences and bouncy basslines. The past few years have seen him busier than ever on the production front with remixes and releases on 16 different labels worldwide while jumping on multiple top 10 lists for Juno Download and Beatport. He recently made the soundcloud weekly top 10 as well making their hottest tracks list for one of his fully original tracks, Neon Night Light. His Ray Charles remix made it to #4 on The Hype Machine's most popular list which was the third time he made their top 20 list. He is fast approaching 100 tracks on his soundcloud page and recently blew past 500,000 plays and 100,000 downloads. Autumn 2013 will see the release of 2 ep's as well as plenty of tracks to be handed out on the web. On the visual side, his youtube channel is fast approaching 500,000 plays. In the past couple years his tracks have been turning up in DJ sets all around the world to packed dancefloors everywhere.

Along with his rigorous production schedule, 2012-13 found Bobby traveling almost 50,000 miles to plays shows and festivals in 11 countries. He's undertaken 2 tours of Europe and Canada in the past year as well as playing major markets in the US. When not headlining his own shows, Bobby has shared the stage with a number of heavy-hitters including George Clinton and the P-funk Allstars (2 times), Pretty Lights (3 times), Thievery Corporation, Z-Trip (18 times), Rjd2 (2 times), Q-Bert, Blackalicious, Gramatik (2 times), Krafty Kuts, A Skillz (2 times), De La Soul, The Pharcyde, Rakim, Madlib, DJ Yoda (2 times), Guru from Gangstarr, People Under the Stairs, DJ Cash Money, Kid Capri, DJ Greyboy, DJ Vadim (2 times), DJ Klever (2 times), DJ Spinna, Kid Koala, Digital Underground, Naughty By Nature, Rudy Ray Moore a.k.a Dolomite, Maceo Parker, Kool Keith, Daniel Johnston, John Scofield and so on and so on.",12594,128,https://www.facebook.com/Bobbycsoundtv,https://www.facebook.com/Bobbycsoundtv,http://twitter.com/BobbyCSoundTV,http://www.youtube.com/user/BobbyCSTV,,1,Rhett@wolfcastleagency.comNorb@stamina-agency.comBobbycsoundtv@gmail.com

The original turntable trickster and funk maestro, the award-winning Jimi Needles is the London party-starter DJ of choice. Jimi's musical origins are routed in hip hop, soul, funk and disco but brings to the turntables a fusion of pin-point scratching, breaks & bass music. His cut-n-paste antics leave virtually no genre untouched creating the ultimate live soundtrack whilst always showing recognition to old school and retro classics.

He’s best known for his intricate genre-spanning party mixtapes, deck-defying festival sets and his array of varied bootlegs & original productions on labels such as Rocstar, Bombstrikes, Respect Music & Jungle Strikes. 2015 saw Jimi take on huge stages at Glastonbury, Shambala and Blissfields as a solo artist, and an extensive tour with his soul band Ephemerals (Jalapeño Records).

How It Works:

1) Select the number of songs that you want mastered from our order form: http://monarchmastering.com/order

(All payments are made through Paypal)

2) Once payment is confirmed you will be automatically redirected to an upload form where you can upload your tracks in Wav. Format, and without limiters on the final master bus.

We just need the final master mix individual track (not each individual instrument track/stems)

3) We will master your songs ensuring that each one reaches its optimal potential. Our mastering process guarantees that your tracks can be up to par with modern tracks not in only in volume/thickness but in crystal clear clarity as well.

We also fix any phase issues to ensure your tracks playback consistency on every type of speaker whether it be an iPod, Car or a Club System.

4) We will email you a secure, private download link from our personal Mediafire Server that will contain 2 versions of each song that you send to us (1 with commercial loudness and 1 with more dynamic range) in Wav. format, 24 bit quality.

5) You are guaranteed to receive your tracks within 48 hours of your upload.

Bio

Zimmer writes dreamy, modern and colorful house music. He is part of the new wave of Paris producers redefining French House, alongside Roche Musique label mates Darius, FKJ, Kartell and more. 

In the few years he’s been around, Zimmer’s made his name largely of blog-hit remixes, earning millions of plays and support across the globe. He broke out in 2014 with his remix for Danish singer MØ , clocking over 5 millions plays. His original work proves just as good: « Galapagos » is a luminous slow house gateway, while “Saturday Love” dips into night- time. True tastemaker, his religiously followed mixtape series keeps listeners in a year-round summer state of mind. 

His new EP « Coming of Age » marks his transformation into a well rounded artist ready to take it to the next level, with a more refined, minimalist sound. Recorded between Paris and Los Angeles, the EP oscillates between euphoric moments and nostalgia, seamlessly travelling between soundscapes. 

But perhaps the best way to experience the magic power of Zimmer is to see him DJ. His busy touring schedule took him all around the globe with over 80 dates in 2014, including sold out shows in NYC, SF and Paris. Coming of Age will be followed with a huge world tour that’s set to take Zimmer’s sound on festival stages and clubs alike.

Scott Melker,Hip-Hop,Scott Melker,http://soundcloud.com/scottmelker,greg@datatouring.com,"I had 150 tracks on my account and 30 million listens. They have all been removed for copyright issues. Please visit youtube.com/scottmelker to hear some of my music.

Producer, Remixer, DJ, Performer, Music Guru. AKA The Melker Project & Gelt Group.

Booking - greg@datatouring.com
Management - zac@tealbluemanagement.com

When you walk away from six-figure job offers to pursue the art of making music, you have an enormous amount of passion, talent, or a combination of the two. 

Such was the case for producer and DJ Scott Melker. It was the right move - during his seventeen years in music, Melker has played alongside legends in the industry such as Future, Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa, Crosby Still & Nash, Neyo, Sheryl Crow, T.I., Jason Derulo, Public Enemy, Kanye West, DJ AM, Steve Aoki, A-Trak and more. Trained in the true turntablist fashion, has also performed at private events around the globe for celebrities and public figures including Billy Joel, Donna Summer, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Donald Trump and even President Barack Obama.  

His talent, however, transcends his duties behind the decks. His productions have topped charts around the world, including 5 number 1 hits on The Hype Machine. His remixes, which initially transformed the name Scott Melker into a viral phenomenon, have been spotlighted by VH1, Fuse TV, Billboard, Prefix Magazine, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Paper Magazine (to name a few). Before having all of his tracks removed from Soundcloud in copyright disputes, Melker had acquired over 30 million total listens.

In an age oversaturated with run-of-the-mill producers, it would appear the key to success lies in heavy marketing. Despite all the noise in the industry, though, Melker has managed to command a global audience organically. The key, according to him, is simple: 

“Understand people and their experiences, and use music as an emotional currency. Give somebody a piece of their childhood back through a classic record, but slice, dice and blend it so that it’s fresh and original. Make it your own.” –Scott Melker 

Drawing inspiration from a diverse and genre-savvy catalog of records, Melker is among the few selectors challenging the mainstream surge of recycled melodies, lackluster bangers and cookie cutter hits. Whether he’s working in the studio, behind the decks at an intimate lounge, or on stage at a festival mixing live for a crowd of 35,000, Melker never loses sight of three invaluable commandments: understand the audience, maintain the flow and always serve good music.

Elizabeth Rose has shared her new single “Shoulda Coulda Woulda” taken from her forthcoming debut album 'Intra', which will be released on March 4 via Midnight Feature/Inertia.

“Shoulda Coulda Woulda” is written and produced in collaboration with M-Phazes showcasing the sonic pop direction which defines 'Intra'. Lyrically, the single portrays the singer’s journey from reflection to motivation. It follows Chrome Sparks' collaboration “Another Earth” earlier this year, and marriage equality anthem “Division” both included on the album.

Elizabeth Rose is an Australian artist with conviction. Proving that earnest ethics and multi-faceted talent have a home in her fiercely independent brand of future pop, Elizabeth Rose is flourishing as a distinct female voice.

Having won countless awards and seeing her self-titled EP shoot to #1 on iTunes Electronic Charts in Australia, the eclectic and RNB-leaning electronic artist (whose live shows incorporate dancing, vivid costumes and joyful audio visuals) has already won hearts on radio stations and stages in Europe, the US and at home. With “Shoulda Coulda Woulda” dropping in time for the summer, expect temperatures to rise and repeat buttons to melt.

With a support list including the likes of DVBBS, Yves V, Deorro, The Chainsmokers, Alvaro , Chuckie, Danny Avilla, Tommie Sunshine, Henry Fong, Will Sparks, Timmy Trumpet and countless others it's no surprise these masked party starters from Melbourne are one of the fastest rising talents to come out of Australia. With an arsenal of productions behind them the duo have had their works featured on EDM's premier main stages, from Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival to EDC and an official Q-Dance stage anthem! 

oh, all while firmly keeping their identities a closely guarded secret..

Their high energy, high impact shows see the pair blending anything from Electro, Trap & Dubstep to their signature brand of Melbourne Bounce coupled along with their loyal fans, known lovingly as the ""Masklife Nation"", have seen them propelled to #9 in the InTheMix top50 national Dj poll, being hand-picked by Sol Republic as Brand Representatives AND earning their place as National Main Stage residents of Australia's GoodLife Music Tour between the likes of Deadmau5,  Hardwell, Avicii, Afrojack, Knife Party, R3Hab, Porter Robinson and more of EDM's Royalty.

Known for their diversity; their duo's production prowess have repeatedly climbed to the top tiers of Beatport's charts,  Releasing on labels like Dim Mak, Ministry of Sound, and Onelove and taking out numerous spots in the electro house genre, an 8 month streak as #1 in the minimal Genre whilst scoring a impressive run in the hiphop charts with a top 50 placement.  

No stranger to the global stage either, these masked crusaders have already taken their electric stage presence and theatrics across the globe! With several US & Mexican shows runs already under their belt and a slew of appearances across Asia including Mongolia, Indonesia, Hong Kong & South Korea, there seems to be no end in sight for these two with their only goal being total world domination!",83193,66,http://www.facebook.com/weareslicendice,http://www.facebook.com/weareslicendice,http://twitter.com/weareslicendice,http://www.youtube.com/user/sliceanddicedj,"http://www.weareslicendice.com/

Tommy Trash has told us that he is Australia’s answer to Deadmau5. Kicking off 2015 with a bang, Winnel announced he has joined the inaugural Armada Music family signing a record & management deal, while lovingly cooking popcorn on the side, it really is impossible to bundle Dave Winnel into the standard rabble of DJs and producers. Seizing a unique applause, the Dave Winnel sound strides in the future bass domain but with Winnel’s organic & melodic touch, and with continued support from the likes of Pete Tong on his Radio 1 Essential Selection & Oliver Heldens it is fair to say Dave Winnel is on cue & leading the way for Future House in Australia.

This Sydney sider broke boundaries with his buzz track Achtung!, (which ironically means Attention!) literally standing at attention being played at every major festival from EDC Las Vegas to the mainstages at Tomorrowland. The Winnel profile isn’t shy of an official remix devoir either, lending his skills to Clean Bandit for ‘Real Love’, Peking Duk’s ‘Take Me Over’ and #1 ARIA Club Chart theft with Glover’s ‘Faces’. High accolades from Michael Woods’ and his label Diffused Music have spilled in; Dave Winnel delighting his fellow producer, breaking the mold on his recent drops and officially remixing for the Englishman too. Celebrating raw talent Oliver Helden’s holds true to Dave Winnel, featuring three of his tracks on Heldeep Radio and personally thanking the Australian talent for making such great music.

Dave Winnel’s smooth performance method has roped in credit as 2014’s Ministry of Sound ‘Electro House Sessions’ asset charging with affect across the country, boasting electronic stamina and full commitment to the dance floor. It’s Dave’s highly acclaimed shows at Pacha Sydney, Platinum and The Met that are pioneering leaving just enough room for Australia’s hottest festivals Future Music Festival, Stereosonic and Summafieldayze where an electric guest spot from Dave is undeniable.

The times ahead call confidently for this young Australian talent, deviating from the norm and bringing the vibe with 2 remixes for Axtone and a slew of releases on ARMADA.

JazzyFunk from Italy is an experimental Indie Dance / Nu Disco / Deep House Band with Funky and Soul influences. It was formed in 2009 by a collaboration with Macs Cortella (dj/producer) and Filippo Perbellini (singer/musician). The concept is based on customizing the live show with a full involvement with the audience, making it a complete performance experience.
All tracks are reworked and re-edited with what they call, “JF Mix” overlapping electronic effects and loops with live musical improvisations. Collaborations with real instruments allow us to have a great variety of sounds to expand and amplify our live set.

JazzyFunk represents a great innovation in the Deep House Music’s panorama of the last two years. Their revolutionary way of making music have captured a large amount of people, boasting collaborations with Sasse, Mark Lower, Saccao, Haze-M, Vintage Culture, Jamie Antonelli, Max Lyazgin, Heavy Pins, Alceen, Matvey Emerson, Chemical Surf, and many more… We have been performing in: Italy, Germany, France, Spain, England, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, Russia, Polonia, Lithuania, Egypt. We love to interact with people, we believe in the magic power of the live act and parties where many energies, in the same place, can create a unique atmosphere.

We actually released Eps/Single with the following labels :

Sleazy Deep, Nervous Records, King Street Sound, Armada Music, Indiana Tones, Enormous Tunes, MoodMusic, Nouveau Niveau, Erase Records, Toolroom Records, Spirit Soul Records, Dèepalma Records, Kiez Beats, Frequenza Limited, Prison Entertainment, Nin92wo Records, Dear Deer Records, Adult Music Records, Hator Records, D2 Records, Da Way Records, Beachside Records, Molotov21, RikoDisko, SLiCK Records, Music Evolution Records, Crossworld Vintage, Moustache Label, Natural High, TheSounds, among others…",6954,176,https://www.facebook.com/JazzyFunkMusic,https://www.facebook.com/JazzyFunkMusic,https://twitter.com/JazzyFunkMusic,http://www.youtube.com/mrjazzyfunk,"http://www.jazzyfunk.it

In November 2015 he released his remix on Interscope Records with Jack Novak for alternative rock band X Ambassadorsâ€™ hit single, â€œUnsteadyâ€�.

Hailing from the depths of Wanganui in New Zealand, Holly-J catapulted onto the Australian music scene seven years ago and hasn't once looked back. Spending most of her nights in crowded clubs right around the country, Holly-J has earned a strong reputation by constantly delivering fun, raging sets filled with her vocal edits and remixes. She has also been recognised internationally, throwing down in cities right across America, Asia and New Zealand.

 

Adding to her impressive bag of tricks, Holly-J manages her own record label, has run a weekly club night, acted as a booking agent and artist manager for several well known artists whilst with Lucky Ent, and has hosted a number of radio shows including residencies on Fox Fm and The Vibe in Las Vegas. Many have admired her tunes following numerous official releases with both original records and remixes gaining serious support from some of the biggest names in the industry.



To pin-point one particular sound to describe what Holly-J does would be impossible â€¦. So we won't.

Instead we will split it up for you in order to create the full picture of what she is all about.



Holly-J â€“ Commercial Bounce:

Being 'able to cater to any crowd' is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot, but Holly-J has the skill & experience to switch effortlessly between any genres, making her a party favourite & floor filler. Pulling from the best in old school RNB, hip hop & party tunes alongside her own vocal edits & mashups, Holly-J's energy & antics shine through at every venue she rocks!

 

Holly-J - Oldschool:

Holly-J was amongst the 'original' crew that pioneered what is now referred to as ""Old School Melbourne Sound"".

With the more recently named 'Bounce' having evolved into something a lot friendlier, these heavier 'old school' sets are in huge demand again, taking the froffers back to when the clubs were darker & the music filthier.

Be sure to check out her 'De Ja Vu' podcast series.

 

 JINXIT:

JINXIT is Holly-J's alter ego - a creative outlet one might say.

This is where she can tend to her love for Trap, and appease her strange side by dabbling with some weird and wonderful sounds.

Arthur Snippe (also known as Art Inc.) was born on July 17, 1993. Music has always been a big aspect in his life, but things really started at the age of 11. Arthur found out he could make his own music by using a computer and some software. Playing and experimenting resulted in his first official remix in February 2008, at the age of 14. 

Although most of his productions might be classified as â€˜house with eclectic influencesâ€™, Arthur is not one to put in a box. Producing means experimenting and thus Arthur also tends to produce styles ranging from trap to moombahton to techno under various aliases. Regarding his Art Inc. alias, he has released on labels such as Hardwellâ€™s 'Revealed Recordings' and Ferry Corsten's 'Flashover Recordings'. Already receiving support from the likes of Hardwell, Nicky Romero, Blasterjaxx and W&W among others, shows that his hard works pays off. This guy is definitely one to look out for!

The Tallinn, Estonia based DJ fuses the rich legacy of UK bass science with the beat alchemy of Angolan Kuduro and other â€žNew Worldâ€œ genres , establishing a trans-national, hyper-hybrid sound that directs towards the future.

In his hometown Tallinn, Estonia, Bert Prikenfeld has been a househould name since the mid 1990s. Starting his career as DJ 
Critikal, Bert soon became EstoniaÂ´s Nr.1 hip hop DJ, playing various club shows every week, and starting to produce his own cuts. Bert soon moved to Drum nÂ´Bass and released his first album in 1999 which was critically acclaimed in Estonia and Finland.  
 
Throughtout the 00s, Critikal forged his sound engineering skills in productions for various Finnish and Estonian music projects and proceeded musically to early dub step and Baltimore club and the Rio Baile Funk compilations and releases of Berlin DJ and Man Recordings head Daniel Haaksman. When Haaksman initiated a remix contest for his track â€žKid Congaâ€œ in 2009, Bert provided a remix under his new moniker Bert On Beats. Haaksman immediately recognised the production quality of BertÂ´s remix contest contribution and it became the winning remix. Soon Haaksman asked for more tracks by Bert On Beats and he was impressed by the fresh approach that Bert showed in fusing dubstep basslines with the in-your-face aesthetic of Jump Up Drum nÂ´Bass and the wave of new, â€žghettoâ€œ genres like Kuduro, Baile Funk or Soca. 
 
In between his single releases, remixes followed for Vybz Kartel, Buraka Som Sistema, Rudimental, Ku Bo, Gotan Project or Gaudi. His tracks currently get support from world class DJs such as ToddlaT, Burns, FatBoySlim, Sinden, Brodinski, Diplo, DropTheLime, Feadz, Foaomo or Douster amongst others.",7714,69,http://www.facebook.com/pages/BERT-ON-BEATS/118718011486228?ref=sgm,http://www.facebook.com/pages/BERT-ON-BEATS/118718011486228?ref=sgm,http://twitter.com/#!/BertOnBeats,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7gweKHNkr8,,3,office@baladabooking.comjeroen@blipagency.combertonbeats@gmail.com

DJ Dechard,Chill/Mainstream,Ricky Dechard,http://soundcloud.com/djdechard,charmaine@charmaineprfirm.com,"Riccardo Di Benedetto (born 21 July 1989), better known by his stage name Dechard, is born and raised in Italy with Belgian origins. He has culminated a vast creative portfolio with influence both from his native European roots and his new American experiences in Los Angeles.

Dechard established himself in both the urban and electronic music genres as his music has a vintage, yet modern vibe. Stomping grooves, dreamy chords, cinematic atmospheres, and an array of collaborations with other artists all act as catalysts for Dechardâ€™s fully original style and sound.

Since the age of sixteen, Dechard has been performing in clubs and across many different stages. He studied sound engineering at Essex University and has built his own recording studio, worked on a variety of projects, and he landed a deal to officially remix a single for Alex Vargas (EMI, UK) with music producer Jeroosalem. Heâ€™s also released remixed for artists such as EDX, Bob Sinclar and Phaze Project.

His first EP was released in 2013, â€˜Amazing,â€™ an album inspired by Dechardâ€™s desire to take his art a step further by departing the European music scene for America. Shortly after arriving in the United States, he has been discovered by the Hollywood publicist Charmaine Blake and also worked on a soundtrack for a Fox television series, â€˜Dos Lunasâ€™. 

Dechard released two more EPâ€™s in 2014, â€˜Three Gemsâ€™ and â€˜Balloons' (Irma Records, Italy). Heâ€™s also co-producing a record for the rising star Sabrina Petrini in collaboration with Gabe Lopez (Universal). 
His debut single going by the name of ""Ricky Dechard"", to be expected in 2016, is currently in the works.

Holly Drummond,Chill/Mainstream,Holly Drummond,http://soundcloud.com/hollydrummond,info@hollydrummond.com,"21 Year Old Scottish Singer/Songwriter and EDM Vocalist.
Contact: info@hollydrummond.com

  Holly Drummond has been described as a â€œfemale Damien Riceâ€�. The 21 year old singer/songwriter from Edinburgh started showcasing her music to the world at the age of 15 when she started posting videos onto YouTube. It was her cover of â€œAlejandroâ€� by Lady Gaga that attracted over 150,000 views, gaining her hundreds of fans and kick starting her music career.

  Since then, Holly has released four EPs. The three most recent - Cloud Nine, In the Dark and Diving In - are available on iTunes. The lead track of In the Dark, 'These Four Walls', has been featured in a few episodes of the UK TV show Hollyoaks. When Cloud Nine was released in 2012 it charted at number 10 in the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart, attracting attention from iTunes who labelled it as 'New and Noteworthy'.

  Holly takes inspiration from artists such as Imogen Heap, Daughter, Lucy Rose, Regina Spektor and many others. Her sound has been compared to the likes of Dido, Suzanne Vega, Nick Drake and Lucy Rose, with a touch of Paramore. Hollyâ€™s lyrics have been described as â€œhumble and wise beyond her yearsâ€�.

  Holly Drummondâ€™s talent for writing has seen her win the Burnsong Under 21 Singer/Songwriter Award and also be nominated for The Forth One To Watch Award. As well as writing and playing all the instruments on her tracks (including cello), she records, mixes and produces them all herself in her own bedroom studio.

  In addition to writing her own original songs, Holly Drummond writes and records vocals for Electronic Dance Music artists. Holly has worked with promising producers such as Direct, Rameses B, Eminence, TwoThirds, Elliot Berger and many others. She has had releases on the large Canadian EDM label Monstercat which have charted at Number 1 in the iTunes Albums Chart.

  Through her collaborations with many other artists and her own videos, Holly has racked up an impressive total of over 4 million views on YouTube. As well as her EDM collaborations, Holly has worked with other singer/songwriters such as Lewis Mokler, Frank Hamilton and fellow Scot, Danny Shah.

  Holly is currently working on a new EP which is due to be released later in 2015.",11526,64,http://www.facebook.com/hollydrummondmusic,http://www.facebook.com/hollydrummondmusic,http://www.twitter.com/holly_drummond,http://www.youtube.com/smoothiesforme,"http://www.hollydrummond.com

BIO:
Jordan got into trap music at a young age growing up in Texas. His love for southern style hip-hop beats mixed with his background in British music he grew up with lead to an interesting mix.

When he moved to the UK he attended the same school as HUCCI, living in Brighton he became involved with the VEYRON camp because of his outstanding production at such a young age and his proximity to the team within the city.

He taught himself how to use FL Studio and began to practice and master his craft whilst honing his own unique EDM Club Trap style.

Gaining support for notable DJ's around the world, as well as Trap Nation one of the biggest EDM/ networks on YouTube he was able to rack up over 4,000,000 views in total on their channel alone.

His biggest song there is Darkness which has almost 850,000 views.

During the year of 2015 his SoundCloud following grew from 800 to 12,000 in just under 6 months.

In September of 2015 he was invited to play alongside VEYRON ARCHE Royalty 'OZZIE' in a string of shows across eastern Canada.

With his new music racking up thousands of hits in hours and his style and sound constant developing, Jordan is one to watch for 2016.",16259,11,https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011369624646,https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011369624646,https://twitter.com/JordanComolli,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyqdV4COiyOC66tOdsYLYtQ,,13,contact@jordancomolli.com

Pyrrhic is the primary force behind the mysterious power of hipsters. This trend setting genius has a backstory as big as The Hulk on steroids and many believe him to be as crucial to life as the air that we breathe. Often famed for slaying dragon’s and being the only person to have a stare-off with medusa, Pyrrhic is also assumed to of accumulated 12 Olympic gold medals, 4 World Cup Trophies and the coveted Weight Watchers member of the year title (albeit under a different guise)… But who really gives a fuck!?

Anyway… 10 years ago, Pyrrhic went through a series of unfortunate events, spending nights intoxicated by enigmatic substances (some even say they once saw him licking an endangered toad for a new high). This mystifying combination of narcotics enabled Pyrrhic to hear the world in a different way, hence is obsession with music. To contain this, powerful members of the underground unicorn world trapped Pyrrhic in the phantom zone in the fear of him unleashing forward thinking, experimental music on the world.

Now, in the year of 2014… Pyrrhic has escaped! After being trapped for 10 years, Pyrrhic has mastered the art of spirituality and connected his soul to that of the unicorns. He is now traveling the world on his beloved unicorn recording all of the peculiar sounds he once wanted to create. With influences from Tonga to Taiwan, Pyrrhic is doing it for the love and musical enlightenment… Musical genius has never been so accessible!

DJ / Production 
Label Owner and Head of A&R at Capital Heaven
----------- 
Framewerk (aka Darren James and Alec Milliner) formed in 2013 to encompass the fresh sound of nu disco. Over time their productions and DJ sets have evolved to what might be classed as ""electronica"" - bridging the gap between deep house, tech house, break and chill out.
 Within a relatively short period they have had the privilege to work with such labels as Toolroom, Selador, Armada, Global Underground, Chapter 24, Sleazy Deep, Prison Entertainment, Great Nights, and Dear Deer (plus many more); gaining recognition from the likes of Nick Warren, Carl Cox, Dave Seaman, Tiesto and Danny Tenaglia along the way.   
 Beside running their own Capital Heaven imprint, the duo hosts a monthly slot on the legendary Tunnel FM alongside guest appearances on Frisky Radio.
 Their DJ bookings have seen them play globally to thousands over the last three years. Their productions and remixes have been charted the world over. Going into 2016, there are no signs of any of that slowing down!

The Librarian,House,Andrea Graham,http://soundcloud.com/the-librarian,grant@paquinartistsagency.com,"Shhhhhhhh! Andrea Graham is known as the Librarian, but don't be fooled by her deceptively quiet composure. The Bass Coast Music Festival's co-founder and music curator has been making some very loud noises up and down the Pacific Northwest for the better part of a decade. Her knack for blending total dance floor destruction with sly subtleties and hot new exclusives makes for a consistently accessible, yet undeniably future sound. Indeed, her festival's carefully crafted music line-up is a perfect mirror of her style. Serving up a veritable who's who of the West Coast bass scene and reaching deep both backwards and forwards, The Librarian offers up unabashedly hard-hitting low-end bliss paired with thoughtful, sophisticated chops.

In addition to curating and co-producing Bass Coast since its 2009 inauguration, Andrea has toured the Pacific Northwest club & festival circuit extensively (Shambhala, Symbiosis, Rifflandia, Envision, Meme,Tall Tree, Burning Man, Sync, Envision, World Ski & Snowboarding Festival, and more), and has performed as far as Costa Rica and midwest to Winnipeg & Wyoming. She has played alongside  Pinch, J Kenzo, dBridge, UZ, Bauer, Dub FX, Silkie, Distance, Addison Groove, Machinedrum, Om Unit, Grenier, Kastle, TRUTH, Deadbeat, Marty Party, Excision, Zed’s Dead, Mimosa, Vibesquad, Ana Sia, Danny Corn, Reso, Rusko, Caspa, Appleblim, 2562, Stagga, Djunya, BSE, Kutz, & many more.

In summer 2013, The Librarian was officially made a member of West Coast's notorious Lighta! Sound crew, joining deep bass pioneers Michael Red, Daega Sound, Max Ulis, Self Evident, Taal Mala, Mandai, Tank Gyal, Cure, & Calamalka.

The Librarian currently has releases out on East Van Digital and King Deluxe with more to come this fall. Her weekly residency is in Whistler B.C. at Maxx Fish's Really Good Tuesdays with Mat The Alien.

Kine Hjeldnes,Indie/Alternative,Kine  Hjeldnes,http://soundcloud.com/kinehjeldnes,kinehjeldnes@gmail.com,"Kine Hjeldnes is a self taught musician born and raised in a small town in the south of Norway. She began writing songs in 2008 when she randomly fell into a music shop and bought a very cheap and terrible guitar. Although she's still pretty unfamiliar with scales, chord progressions and pop recipies, she has developed her songwriting from being one chord songs into a more complex universe. 

“It’s been hard work to learn how to play and write songs at 26 but creating music gives me the feeling of falling in love. It’s something I've been longing for my whole life. It's a necessity for me to create. It’s like food or sleep. Of course I would survive without music, but the need feels as important as any other basic need. And songwriting is like a drug for me. I keep coming back because it makes me feel so good.”

In 2014 she released her first studio EP Elude. It’s a record about how you can never see through someones skin or ever know what they really feel. The songs where written with a broken heart, a lack of trust in the world and the future. 

Kine recently released her new singel Lovers, and are currently working on her first full length album.

Trevor Leon: tleon@littleempiremusic.com

Relatively new to the EDM front, the mutli-national Suspect 44 have recently been taking massive strides to stardom since their debut on the legendary Anjunadeep label with their monster hits ""Japanese Schoolgirls"" and ""Neon Feel.” Despite being located in two separate countries across the globe (The United States and The Netherlands), Luke Shipstad and Zhiar Mahmoud have been writing music together for years. Their hit release on the powerhouse Armada Trice label, ""Amazing"", not only reached the #1 spot on the Beatport Top 100 (Trance) and then remained in the top 10 for over a month, but showed the promise Suspect 44 really holds. 2015 proved to be no different, kicking off the year with a top 10 track, “I Feel It” in the Progressive House charts. 2015 closed with their progressive hit “Here Right Now,” which was supported by Hardwell, Armin van Buuren, Nicky Romero, The Chainsmokers, and many others. Unbound by genre lines, Suspect 44 now aims to bring together the wildly catchy vibes from pop genres and lush melodies of Progressive House; the result to say the least is powerful, unique and fresh.

Wax Motif,Creative,,http://soundcloud.com/waxmotif,contact@littleempiremusic.com,"TRUE JOY EP – OUT NOW on Mad Decent:
http://maddecent.lnk.to/TrueJoy

Fav jams, updated regularly: http://bit.ly/WaxxyWavez

BIO::
Born in Australia as Danny Chien, Wax Motif’s unique production style and mixing skills have kept this rising producer in high demand. Continually wowing fans and industry insiders, his production efforts have drawn critical acclaim and support from the likes of Diplo / Major Lazer, A-trak, RL Grime, GTA, Oliver Heldens, Jauz, Knife Party, Tommy Trash and more.

Wax Motif has become a pioneer for the G-House movement, working with Destructo for his album on Interscope with the likes of Ty Dolla Sign, YG, Yung Thug, Problem, Kurupt and Warren G. His DJ sets already incorporate this style heavily into his mixing, and 2015 will see a lot of original productions in this vibe.

To pigeonhole Wax Motif’s music would be disingenuous, however. His influences range from R&B, to disco and UK bass, and his diversity in the studio has attracted the attention of everyone from Mau5trap to OWSLA.  His debut EP for Mad Decent, True Joy, is a reflection of this multi-genre approach, albeit with a G-house focus.  

 No stranger to the festival circuit, Wax has played EDC Las Vegas, New York & Mexico, HARD Summer & Day of the Dead, Holy Ship, Stereosonic and Splendour in the Grass to name a few. Wax has released tracks and remixes through A-trak’s Fool’s Gold, Skrillex's OWSLA, and Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak Records, a compilation on legendary label Strictly Rhythm as well as a host of remixes for the likes of YG, Kid Ink, Chromeo, Deadmau5, Warren G’s “Regulate” and more.

GIRL FROM BERLIN.
__________________________

In times of an already vast ‘Soundcloud-Generation, that is continuously growing and bringing forth new and highly ambitious DJ’s, it is certainly not easy to separate yourself from the herd. However, the search for individuality and exhilarating mix between a casual mood and a breeze of the past decades brings us straight to the music of a talented young artist: introducing, LOVRA.

Being born in the German provinces, Laura discovered her love for music in her early childhood. Her excellent sense in rhythm and her affinity for aesthetical movements brought her to into the world of ballet on a very young age. The following years Laura her enthusiasm towards sounds and tones peaked and slipped its way into her professional career path and enabled her to express her versatile creativity.

After studies in Design, Laura moved to Berlin. The German capital finally gave Laura the creative environment she was looking for. In the epicentre of the artistic freedom she found new impulses and ideas for her music, making the move to Berlin one of the best decisions in her life.

As a successful graphic designer, model and recently music producer, Laura bundles her creative activities under her artistic name LOVRA. LOVRA is a free spirit who has given herself the objective to unite her passion and vocation in a magical/wondrous way. Just recently she has signed her first major deal and couldn’t be any happier with the growing positive feedback of her followers: “Berlin is a very open-minded city. To be able to meet and learn from inspiring new people on a daily basis and to be introduced to their opinions and perspectives is something that means a lot to me!”

By combining her attraction towards music from the eighties and nineties and her natural feeling for modern melodies, LOVRA creates her own distinctive sound. Her tracks, full with groovy House-tunes, striking vocals and danceable beats, will reverberate in our ears for a long time.
LOVRA, who keeps reinventing herself with every gig she plays and every track she makes, carries us away with unparalleled sound spheres. Driven by the curiosity for new beats and wanting to give the music of the past decades a loving homage, LOVRA is well on track. With her remake of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On” and her own creations, she already gave us and her crowd some wonderful moments. We are very much looking forward to a thrilling career and to an artist that has earned the right to be called “unique” more than anyone else.

THE FUNK HUNTERS
@WestwoodRecordings | Canada


The Funk Hunters are one of Canada’s top breakout acts, gaining accolades from all corners of the electronic music scene and pushing boundaries with the constant evolution of their live stage show featuring custom synched visuals and a LIVE 6-piece band. Nick Middleton and Duncan Smith have redefined their sound, bridging the gap between electronic and live music. Originally carving out a name for themselves by reviving and remixing rare classics, their focus has turned to creating original compositions and collaborating with world class musicians and vocalists both in the studio and on stage. Combining the melody and emotion of funk and soul with the grit and heavy punch of electronic drums and basslines, The Funk Hunters signature sound has been selling out venues across the country and leading them on tours around the world. During live shows, their 4-turntable Audio Visual set now shares the stage with a full band including live vocals, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, keys and drums.

The Funk Hunters have had a busy year and it’s no wonder why. Managing and producing music for their own imprint/record label ‘Westwood Recordings,’ coupled with their North American, European, Australian and New Zealand tours, the duo burst into the international music spotlight in 2012 and quickly gained momentum worldwide. Integrating a custom synced video set with live musicians is not only visually captivating but is pushing the boundaries of performance innovation. Awing audiences with their acclaimed audio visual show, The Funk Hunters Live set is charismatic, energetic and ambitious with no signs of slowing down. If you haven’t already, it might be time to get captured by the funk.

________________________________

Matt Halper and Eli Sones, the young masterminds behind Two Friends, have quickly revamped from high school bedroom producers to one of the most promising dance music duos of 2016. Known for their viral remixes of “Trap Queen”, “I Miss You” and “Cool”, the two have, in unprecedented time, mastered a wide range of genres from deep, melodic house to harder progressive cuts. With their Spotify and SoundCloud views now exceeding 17 million and with eleven #1’s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America.   

Kicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Blink 182, Tori Kelly and Alesso to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct “Soul House” style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the “Award of Independent Excellence” from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey’s hit “Born To Die” scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014. 

Following multiple performances at San Francisco’s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York’s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Denmark, Mexico and Canada, showing off their potential in the international arena.

With support now coming from the likes of The Chainsmokers, Krewella and Tritonal, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2016, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.

Coming hot off of their first unofficial release via Buygore Records with a heavy trap EP, Vienna, Vice City is back in their first official BG release, Lights, now available for purchase via Beatport, Spotify, and iTunes.

Hailing from the South - Vice City began their musical careers as individual solo projects, Freiheit & SON!X, meeting by way of the internet via online collaborations. This Texas & Florida native had the same creative vision, and after winning a few remix competitions together, the next logical step was to combine forces and make both dreams a reality.

As you begin Lights, ""Addiction"" is gradually presented with wide, celestial melodies, uplifting you to a subtle drop, keeping the dramatic tension as your met once again with tantalizing synths. As if from day to night - ""Block Party"" swoops in with full energy as Vice City turns up the heat in this Melbourne bounce assault. ""Evolve"" gracefully begins with melodic, plucked guitar strings as your whisked away into an 808 drop - mixing bass with quick hi hats and hints of the guitar - winding you up as you fall into the final track. You're met by CreativAngel, dropping swift, staccato phrases as ""Warrior"" ensues, wrapping up Lights.

Showcasing their talent and skills as producers, Vice City mixes a variety of styles and genres into one cohesive, four track EP. There's no turning down for this duo, excited to see what else they have up their sleeve as 2015 comes to a close.

Biography:

Hailing from the Eastern Europe cultural hub of Bucharest, Boehm has quickly made a name for himself in Melodic and Tropical House circles. Though only releasing music under the moniker of Boehm until relatively recently, Alex has been producing music since the age of 12 getting his start in hip-hop and eventually going on to produce several pop hits throughout Europe. Since the conception of “Boehm”, Alex has chosen to set aside all other projects and leave behind all of the accomplishments accumulated thus far. The gamble paid off. Within the last 6 months, he has had four back to back #1 Hype Machine charting songs including his remix for Benjamin Francis Leftwich’s “Won’t Back Down” which hit #1 twice, his remix of Ben Howard’s “I Forget Where We Were”, his remix of James Vincent McMorrow’s cover of “Wicked Games”, and his most recent remix of Cheat Codes' ""Visions"". The widespread appeal of his music can be found everywhere from Tiesto’s weekly podcast – Club Life Radio (where his remix for Tiesto & Martin Garrix premiered on Sirius XM) to your local Starbucks in-store playlist (where his remix of Urban Cone & Tove Lo will be integrated worldwide for the month of August). Add to that an array of musical figures who became fans including heavy weight DJ’s such as Steve Aoki, NERVO, and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike who have requested official remixes from him. As the adventure continues, Boehm is now prepping his first batch of original tunes along with a number of high profile remixes for release in the second half of 2015.",55741,64,https://www.facebook.com/BoehmOfficial,https://www.facebook.com/BoehmOfficial,https://twitter.com/BoehmOfficial,https://www.youtube.com/user/BoehmOfficial,,2,sami@deckstar.comsophie@deckstar.comferry@apa-agency.comharald@mfm-booking.de

It’s easy to see why D.O.D is fast becoming one of the most respected Electro House DJs and producers.  Originally discovered as an ahead-of-the-game local DJ by Mixmag, whose editor Nick Stevenson declared, ‘D.O.D is one of the most talented young DJs and producers we’ve discovered this century. Expect big things.’  D.O.D has since released music on some the world’s most established labels such as Spinnin’, Laidback Luke’s Mixmash, Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak, Bingo Players’ Hysteria Records and Dyro's WOLV.

Originally from Manchester, UK, D.O.D (full name Dan O’Donnell) established a strong work ethic from the age of 15 playing long shifts in local bars and clubs, taking every opportunity to teach himself new tricks on the turntables.  This early thirst for experimentation was instrumental in his career taking off as it quickly generated appreciation from his more established collegues in the business.

A high-powered, charismatic performer, D.O.D intuitively knows how to read a crowd, and his well-structured sets, coupled with a compelling and dynamic delivery, never fail to fuel dance floor euphoria. Positioning his musical style as ‘Jump-Up Electro House’, D.O.D utilizes the full scope of his 4 CDJ set up alongside his own personal edits and bootlegs to greatest effect, citing as inspirational, among other eclectic influences, old skool hip hop scratch DJs.  Pioneer soon got word of D.O.D’s technical prowess and were quick to invite him to showcase a demonstration of their equipment in one of their legendary Pioneer DJ Sounds Shows and has since become one of their brand ambassadors.

In addition to his prodigious talent on the decks, D.O.D has rapidly made a name for himself as an accomplished, innovative dance music producer.  His debut records More Cowbell and Bananas stormed onto the international scene after Dutch legend and superstar DJ Laidback Luke picked them up for his iconic Mixmash label.  Championed by A-list DJs from day one, these two singles became overnight hits.

D.O.D has continued developing in the studio, refining his distinctive signature sound:  a mesmerising combination of high-energy beats and rhythmic bass-lines topped with catchy vocals.   His phenomenal non-stop approach has led to the huge success of three top 10 Beatport hits in the past year, including one of his latest  productions Bust Dem on Spinnin’ Records, a collaboration with American producer Henry Fong.  Others include All Or Nothing, and the massive collaboration Flashing Lights with Laidback Luke, which has to date notched up over 4 million plays on Spotify. 

Along with Laidback Luke, who continues to be a mentor and robust advocate of his work, D.O.D’s music is also strongly supported by such names as Hardwell, Blasterjaxx, Dyro, Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas, Like Mike, Tiesto and many more.

D.O.D’s own Freequence Radio showcase his own production as well as a throve of largely yet undiscovered names, stemming from a belief that encouraging emergent and grassroots talent in this way is vital if the dance music scene is to remain fresh and relevant.  Valuing his fans, D.O.D uses Freequence as a platform for releasing free music frequently to give something back to his dedicated and extending fan base.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, dance music is at its most potent when it’s born out of hunger, passion and talent. As D.O.D builds on his formidable reputation for epitomizing that lust for measured abandonment brilliantly, his intelligent approach and unfaltering work rate continue to drive him to be a key player in this competitive industry.  The scene now eagerly anticipates the inimitable D.O.D’s next move.

Sem Thomasson is a young Belgian dj/producer. Inspired by his father’s musical vibes, he started experimenting with digital samplers and synths as early as his tenth birthday. The pathway to electronic dance music was already steadily set. At the age of eighteen, Sem Thomasson released his first record, the result of years of strenuous hard work. The deejay bookings followed only a short while after and the start of his rich musical career couldn’t have been better planned. He is now fully prepared to let the world meet his peculiar sound and natural talent for making greatly accessible dance tracks. 

He did productions on labels such as Protocol Recordings, Flamingo Recordings, Stealth Records, Spinnin Records, Ultra Records, Atlantic Records, Universal Music and remixes for Steve Aoki, Flo Rida, Jennifer Lopez, Cody Simpson, Nelly Furtado, TV Rock, John Dahlback just to name a few… 

Not only are his productions of a high standard, they also seem to have an immense impact on the crowd. He gained support from all the EDM big names. His music penetrates right through your body to the very core of your dancing nerve centre and that is something not easily achieved. Sem Thomasson is a remarkable talent, someone who knows exactly which way his ship is sailing, without losing the dynamics to steer left or right at a certain point.

Adam K (Hotbox Digital),Festival,Adam K,http://soundcloud.com/adamk,andy@hotboxdigital.com,"Worldwide Bookings; andy@hotboxdigital.com


For Toronto, Canada’s Adam K, it’s tremendous amounts of skill, creativity, hard work, and years of perfecting his craft that have catapulted him into the upper echelon of dance music.

Fuelling his stellar live sets is over 15 years of experience in mastering sound design, audio engineering and producing. His keen ear for shaping sounds and knack for composing emotional hooks fuse together to create his trademark style. Adam’s solo and collaborative projects have dominated the underground including landmark tracks such as “I Can Feel”, “You’re Not Alone”, “Question”, and “From The Speaker” which melded the minds of Adam, long-time friend Soha, and Toolroom frontman Mark Knight. Of course it was another collaboration with Soha that captivated the world with “Twilight”. Named an Essential New Tune on the legendary BBC Radio 1, Pete Tong set the tone for one of the biggest records of 2008, which was confirmed by landing at #2 for the best-selling tracks overall on Beatport that year. Adam’s music is a favourite of the world’s top DJs seeing releases such as “Complicated” be a staple in sets from the likes of Tiesto, Above & Beyond, Gareth Emery, Matt Darey, Rank1, Judge Jules, Cosmic Gate, Menno de Jong, and more.

Not just an original composition mastermind in the studio, it’s Adam’s mind for remixing, along with partner Soha, that has catapulted him into superstardom as the duo’s remixes are some of the most pinnacle dance records of the past few years. Kaskade’s “4AM”, Benny Benassi’s “Come Fly Away”, Deep Swing’s “In The Music”, Heikki L & Ercola’s “Deep At Night” and most notably the Adam K & Soha Remix of Reflekt’s #1 UK Dance Chart tune “Need To Feel Loved” raised the duo to astronomical heights. Adam has reworked singles from dance icons Tiesto and Deadmau5, to mainstream chart-toppers Keri Hilson, Shiny Toy Guns, and Robyn, to one of the most legendary bands of all time in U2. It is his vision, passion, and technique that keep them in high-demand from international hit-makers and underground sensations alike.

Travelling around the globe, Adam’s mastery in the studio translates directly into the art of DJing and he has rocked single-show crowds upwards of 10,000 for legendary promoters and venues such as Ministry of Sound, Godskitchen, Global Gathering, The Guvernment, and Privilege Ibiza. From festivals across Europe, North and South America, Adam’s definitive sound blows up dance floors and pushes the hands to the rafters. Though primarily known for his melodic blend of progressive house, Adam’s style is much more diverse, and showcases his love for all things house, tech to electro, deep to banging. It’s this affection for many genres and his ability to manipulate a crowd into a frenzy that cements his status as one of the world’s most memorable performers.

Not just a producer and DJ, Adam is also the founder and head of Hotbox Digital. The label has been a vehicle for Adam to break into the industry and has released a multitude of incredible tracks from some amazing talent including Soha, Addy, Dataworx, Macca, and JELO. For 2010, Adam has a renewed focus on Hotbox, and will be expanding the label’s international reach both with fresh new original material and new signings from upcoming and established talent, including the massively anticipated Adam K & Soha track “Far Away” featuring the unforgettable vocals of Jeremy Carr, due out later this year.

With collectively over 4 million plays on You Tube and support from the world’s DJ elite, Adam has seen his music effect the lives of music lovers around the world. With the rise of Hotbox Digital and a full slate of touring, solo projects, collaborations, and remixes on the horizon, 2010 is the year of Adam K.",35630,236,http://facebook.com/djadamk,http://facebook.com/djadamk,http://twitter.com/djadamk,http://youtube.com/adamktv,"http://djadamk.com

Hailing from New Orleans, LA, Chase Orduna, better known as Short Circuit utilizes music to express himself and the way he sees the world around him. While starting his music career and writing hip hop productions throughout most of his teenage years, Short Circuit began his journey to discovering a new sound as he entered into his twenties. He became inspired by the likes of well known DJ/Producer Porter Robinson and found his calling through house music and the EDM culture. Shortly after he began to learn the art of mixing and quickly took his status from producer to DJ/Producer. Within two short years Short Circuit began taking his productions to the stage with local performances and started to catch the attention of many local and regional producers along the south. Now, having shared the stage, performing alongside Carnage, The Party Squad, Gladiator, Porter Robinson, R3HAB, Mayhem, Getter, Kid Kamillion, GTA and more, Short Circuit is paving his way to the next evolution of his career and should be kept on the lookout over the next coming years!
Dedicated to his craft, there is no limit one can put on Short Circuit's ability to rock the massives with his wide array of original productions and remixes scaling all the planes of house and dance music. From Big Room to Melbourne Bounce, Electro House to Complextro, Glitch-Hop to Dubstep and more, Short Circuit will captivate you with his hard hitting, diverse performances across all platforms.
Focused on spreading his sound and sharing his productions with the world, Short Circuit is now preparing and scheduling events looking to make his mark one region at a time.",6057,101,https://www.facebook.com/DjShortCircuit,https://www.facebook.com/DjShortCircuit,https://twitter.com/DjShortCircuit_,,"http://www.shortcircuitofficial.com

Firstly under Wynn & Smith feat Youngman in the early 2000's where they landed tracks signed & released on The Ministry Of Sound compilation albums, and more recently ColdCuts. Which resulted in both acts Dj'ing along side the likes of EZ, The Wideboys & Artful dodger.


Then in may 2012 Will decided to change his style of music and created his latest alias DONKIE PUNCH, playing and producing a new sound that has been taking the UK's Underground music scene by storm....... House & Bass. Since then Donkie Punch has earned a reputation for his deep dirty bass driven style of house music, which sees him hold residencies at Birmingham largest club brand 02.31 & Rainbow Venues , where he has shared the bill with artists such as Hannah Wants, Chris Lorenzo, Kry Wolf & Shadow Child amongst many others.


With Donkie Punch touring all over the UK..... Ibiza and even further afield securing regular bookings in and around South America. It's Ironic really that his quote when first starting this adventure was.. 'Has anyone heard of a Donkie Punch' cos ..... they have now !!

Taking influences from game-changing producers in the ever exploding Electro-Hiphop-Glitch-Funk movement, and combining it with elements of bluegrass, folk, blues and jam, Vibe Street (Ben Davis) brings a flavor that is unrivaled in the world of music today. Davis has coined the genre ""Grass-Hop/Future-Folk"" to describe his unique sound - ranging from feel good, blue-grassy tunes, to spacey, soulful electronic beats that can rock a late-night dance tent. Combining forward thinking and versatility, Vibe Street is providing music fans across all spectrums with the refreshing dose of originality that they so desperately crave.

Everything began in 2003 with ordinary parties at night clubs and apartments. They were both interested in house music. Paul was collecting music while graduating from musical school and Panchez was working with tracks and demo-systems. Panchez began writing music and Paul helped him with turning the drafts into a final product. To tell the truth, it was a lot of work in the beginning and not everything was working out the way they wanted. So, they took a little break and began deejaying at the night clubs. They were learning people’s moods and emotions which helped them make their music better. On May, 10 2013 along with Alex Moiss and Eugene Aslanov they began a new project called TRENDY SOUND for promoting types of music such as Deep House, Tech House, Soulful House, Indie Dance, Nu Disco. In the process of working on the project in 2014, members of the TRENDY HOUSE began writing their own tracks in deep house style and named themselves TS TEAM. Music created by the project is full of ideas of each and every member of the team. TS Team is working with record labels like Cloning Sound, Irbis Recordings, Prospection Records. While working on the tracks, Panchez decided to produce not only Deep House music, but also Nu Disco, Electronica, House and Paul supported his idea. Guys are still working with TS TEAM while creating a new project called Paul & Panchez. They came up with the name Paul & Panchez for the project almost spontaneously when Paul though it would be a good idea to combine his name with his friend’s nick name…
By January 2015 Paul & Panchez had no doubt that the new project will give them opportunity to gain a new experience and a new audience.",5681,23,https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009035528536,https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009035528536,https://twitter.com/PaulPanchez,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKEmsfckMEBKJstNk6roQw/videos,"http://www.junodownload.com/artists/Paul+%2526+Panchez/releases/

Codeko, real name Ed Clark, is a 19 year old English DJ/producer hailing from London, UK. He has been classically trained in music from a young age: he plays two orchestral instruments, including the piano since he was just 5 years old.

It was clear that music had always been his passion, and when he started producing at the age of 15, his strong musical foundations allowed him to quickly pick up the nuances of electronic music and showcase his creativity.

Having already racked up millions of plays on his tracks, as well as other achievements like his bootleg remix of ‘Find You’ getting support from Zedd himself, it is clear that Codeko is one to watch. His latest official release did even better; gaining support the likes of Hardwell, W&W, Tritonal and many more. This upwards trajectory shows no signs of stopping; having just signed to Cloud 9 Publishing alongside the likes of Armin van Buuren, as well as a stream of releases lined up for the future, Codeko is going from strength to strength. 

It is early days yet, but it is safe to say you can expect big things to come from Codeko.

Lost in Michael Jackson’s woodland estate, young Will Williamson was a happy soul. Breast fed and reared by a family of disco Llamas, he’d canter hither and tither to his heart’s content, chewing on the lush grass and shrubs planted way back in the Motown days.

Until the day the bulldozers arrived to clear the estate and mine the fabled Tree of Soul. Outraged, the Llamas quickly militarised and Will found himself leading the Llama army against the machines. Sadly for Will and the Llamas, they were trained in combat by Bubbles, Michael Jackson’s favourite monkey and could only offer thrown semen and faeces against their metal foe and it was over as soon as it began.

Heidi Harris,Indie/Alternative,Heidi Harris,http://soundcloud.com/heidi-harris-1,sukisound@yahoo.com,"Booking & info: sukisound@yahoo.com 
New solo album →  'Cave Tides' out 2017 

""At times we are in clearly experimental, disorientating ambient spaces, and at others we are in very clearly structured songs, but I always get the impression that both poles of Harris’ practice are striving towards the same thing: to forge a listening experience that is as unique and unpredictable as life."" -Oliver Arditi 

Heidi's creative practice is based on an exploration and intermingling of traditional and non-traditional sound sources. Repertoire of instruments include: piano, clarinet, harmonica, guitar, melodica, synthesizer, theremin, and various sound makers. 

Heidi contributed many of these sounds including songwriting as a former member of the chamber folk trio http://soundcloud.com/cutleri, later in http://soundcloud.com/knife-throwers-assistance,  an eclectic musical collective based in NYC and continues to collaborate in her band: https://soundcloud.com/heidiandthe9feathers But Heidi's first “instrument” was her own voice. From a young age she performed lead roles in operettas and musicals, and although stylistically she has moved on to more avant-garde territories, the quality and range of her voice still hinges on her theatrical roots.

Heidi attended the Institute of Audio Research in New York City, focusing on the process of recording and producing, and went on to record several self-released albums in her home studio, Suki Sound. Her work has been reviewed by labels and blogs all over the globe, applauding her as a unique and exceptionally prolific songwriter and recording artist.

&gt; Bio :
Born and raised in the illustrious Romanian underground scene, Alex is the man behind the buttons. Between running his own imprint and stamping his already infamous A++ signature onto a highly addictive form of electronic music, the time frame for creative output is perfect.

A++ developed a sound that embodies a unique understanding of both house and dark techno. Not only reworking the gateway between these two genres, but also creating his own style. &lt;",5534,72,https://www.facebook.com/Aplusplusofficial?ref_type=bookmark,https://www.facebook.com/Aplusplusofficial?ref_type=bookmark,http://twitter.com/AlexMindGames,,,6,booking@crossworlder.com

Bio:
Language: English

Ed Hennessey was born in Pennsylvania, USA. Music has always been a part of his life since childhood.

His passion and appreciation for music lead Ed into the world of Djing. He started Djing in the 1980's performing in local clubs and introduced new and diverse music to his crowd.

Ed has been producing for several years and his latest productions have received a very good response. Currently, he is building a studio from the ground up so his music can evolve even higher.

His music and DJ sets have been loved and respected internationally on Soundcloud, The DJ List, Beatport and more. He's had Top Mixes on Beatport and a number one remix on Smashtheclub.com.

Self-taught, Ed Hennessey has always followed his heart towards his goals to create genuine, impassioned music. Throughout the years of practicing and exploration, he is refining his mixing, production, sound engineering and mastering techniques to this day.

His goals are simple. Make music from the heart to please his ears. If someone else likes what he's done, then that's a plus.

biography:
The sun is shining, sunglasses are on, while staring at the clear sky, a warm wind breezes through the air... with the deep blue lake down below. Waves tickling your toes, while enjoying a cold beer. The whisper of the wind in the background, blends together with the sound of the waves and a strong groove coming from the speakers. This atmosphere has an absolute soothing effect and induces this strong feeling of peace and happiness. „It's all good!“ Lakechild is a german deep house music project, consisting of Dominik Wassermann and Nicolas Böttger, founded in 2014.  Their mutual passion for electronic dance music and lakes (the German equivalent to the seaside) brought these two guys together. It was with all this in mind that Lakechild was born. 

Both guys have a thorough background in classical music (piano and French horn) and these influences are still very much a part of their music.  It was while they were still studying for their masters degree in Berlin and Zurich that they produced their biggest hit so far (""Diskostrand“) which sparked their new career. Other productions include „Nacktbaden“, an official remix of Lana Del Rey’s song „Black Beauty"", and the official remix of Angus & Julia Stone's „Grizzly Bear“. With those few defining tracks under their belt, not only did they achieve international success, reaching the #1 spot on Hypem, but they also caught the attention of labels and signed to the emerging Berlin based Record Label Tanz Dich Glücklich.

When asked why Lakechild decided to make music and what they are trying to achieve, their only response was: „Music is...what migrates from one man's heart to another!“ A story which leaves the door wide open for many more chapters to come in 2016...",13467,13,https://www.facebook.com/lakechildmusic,https://www.facebook.com/lakechildmusic,http://www.twitter.com/lakechild_,,"https://www.mixcloud.com/lakechild/

KENKODE & SKINFAKE are Cyberpunkers.
The “Cyberpunkers” project was born in 2006, from the passion of Cyberpunk culture shared by two Italian DJ’s. The group aims to give a fresh start to this style. In a nutshell, a transposition of the Cyberpunk world in modern clubbing. Through their performances at famous clubs, “Cyberpunkers” drew a lot of interest from the European media and ended up being much talked about for both their original look, consisting of masks behind which their true identity is hidden, and for the originality of their shows, in which they use two consoles at once and powered by several other audio machines.
Cyberpunkers have shared the stage at the biggest electronic European music festivals with a lot of worldwide stars.This intense travel and performance schedule did not prevent them from doing a lot of important studio work for their upcoming albums and remixes.

Prismo aka Zach Burgett is a bass music producer/DJ from Houston, TX. Prismo started playing various instruments at a young age including the drums, bass, and guitar. He listened to and was influenced by a variety of bands like Primus, Radiohead, and Billy Talent. He was unsuccessful in his efforts to form a band of his own, so he learned to record and produce his own songs. Once he discovered electronic music acts such as Skrillex and Knife Party, he found his true passion. He began using his acquired production skills to produce electronic music, and hasn't looked back. Prismo has released music on stellar independent dance music labels such as Dim Mak, Firepower, Monstercat, and more. The year 2015 was a pivotal year in his development as an artist and has set him up for a monster 2016. Prismo is definitely one to watch this year, so keep your eyes peeled for lots of music, touring, and festival plays.",30812,119,http://www.facebook.com/PrismoMusic,http://www.facebook.com/PrismoMusic,http://twitter.com/PrismoMusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/PrismoMusic,"http://prismomusic.com/

Red Bull Thre3style US Champion, Lollapalooza 2015 artist, and Chicago Sun Times' #1 DJ (Sun Times' #6 in the U.S.) has been producing music for just as long as he has been gracing the turntables (fifteen years), and playing drums for even longer (two decades). In addition to extensive touring across North America, he has headlined internationally in numerous cities including Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), Beijing (China), Taichung (Taiwan), Stuttgart (Germany), and Zurich (Switzerland). His traditional musical background, including a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies, is a rarity among electronic musicians, and has helped get his original music placed on networks such as MTV, VH1, ESPN, and Style, labels including Firepower Records and Brooklyn Fire, and commercials for Bacardi, Hefty, and Kenmore. While Thre3style put him on the world stage, his passion for dance music, inspired by his home city of Chicago, is what will keep him there.",11593,140,http://facebook.com/djtrentino,http://facebook.com/djtrentino,http://twitter.com/trentinomusic,https://www.youtube.com/user/djtrentino,,6,BookTrentino@gmail.com

Throughout his life, Nathaniel Knows embraced and absorbed an eclectic array of quintessential vibes, honing his unique skills as a genre-bending DJ. Struck by love at first sound, he found his passion for music starting at the tender age of fourteen, in West Coat hip-hop. From hip hop beats he graduated to Trance, DnB, metal, and even Hardcore. As an aviation technician in the navy, he traveled the world picking up new rhythms and learned to produce via PK (A.K.A., the Puerto Rican King), on board the USS JFK. From there he wandered from Florida to Arizona, until he finally landed in the big city, Portland, Oregon. There he hit music hard, branded himself Nathaniel Knows (https://www.facebook.com/nathanielKnowss), and formed with DIGIRATTII https://soundcloud.com/digiraatii


He also works with producers such as HATIRAS http://soundcloud.com/hatiras ,SPL (http://soundcloud.com/spl), TRIAGE (https://soundcloud.com/triage) The Bassist (https://soundcloud.com/bassist) Nate Feelz (https://soundcloud.com/natofeelz) El Cucuy ( http://soundcloud.com/el-cucuy )  GANG$IGN$ (http://soundcloud.com/djgangsigns)
 
Riding the cutting edge of new and emerging music, Nathaniel's outrageous style and distinctive artistry brings an electrifying energy to every venue he dominates.

Ookay,Chill/Mainstream,Ookay,http://soundcloud.com/ookaymusic,ben@circletalentagency.com,"One of the most impressive young leaders of the American trap scene, California-based Ookay (pronounced “okay”) exploded onto the scene when both his freshman and sophomore releases on Ultra Records charted in the top 10 on Beatport. Since then, he’s shown no sign of slowing down, working with some of the greatest producers in electronic music while developing a signature style that weaves across genres, reflecting influences as varied as Borgore, Diplo, DJ Snake, Showtek, Deorro, TJR, Boaz Van de Beatz, Valentino Kahn, Waveracer, Cashmere Cat, Lindsay Lowend, Skrillex, Lido, and Wiwek while always returning to a hard-hitting trap beat.

The producer and DJ has racked up credits and quickly made a name for himself with remixes of tracks like Congrorock’s “Bless Di Nation Ft. Sean Paul” and Steve Aoki, Chris Lake & Tujamo’s “Boneless.” Ookay teamed up with iconic producer Diplo to remix Avicii’s “You Make Me,” and his recent remix of “Kanye” by the Chainsmokers on Republic/Dim Mak Records layers his signature mix of dance music and hip-hop over fluttering pop vocals. His side project Coaster serves as an outlet for his love of alternative dance and house music, proving Ookay to be no one-trick trap pony. 

His much-anticipated spring single ""Bouncer,"" produced with the venerable Dutch duo Showtek, hit the top 3 Beatport overall chart after its March 2014 release and was a staple on summer festival stages across the country. Ookay has also quickly become known as a charismatic performer both on and off stage, appearing at venues like EDC Las Vegas, Electric Zoo, Red Rocks, and TomorrowWorld. His live shows are known for sleek transitions, sensitive song selections, and entertaining MC’ing from the booth. He’s also no slouch on Twitter, commenting on everything from the struggle to Shazam an unknown song to LA’s Korean BBQ scene. 

It’s no surprise that Ghost, out November 10 on Dim Mak Records, is one of the most exciting dance music releases of the fall. Promised to be “a blend of listening tracks as well as club bangers,” it fulfills that goal. Ghost is one of the too-rare records that will bring you from your morning commute, with the meditative “Ghost” and “Matters,” to 4 AM on the dance floor losing it to “Egg Drop Soup.” 

The Ghost Tour this fall and winter is sure to blow up dance floors across America, and truly solidify Ookay’s status as one of America’s premier young electronic artists. With support from such icons as Showtek and Diplo as well as Tiesto, Steve Aoki, Major Lazer, Borgore, Nervo, David Guetta, DJ Snake, Deorro, TJR, Krewella and more, it seems certain that Ookay’s star will only continue to rise.

Voyeur Music,Chill/Mainstream,Voyeur Music,http://soundcloud.com/voyeurmusic,voyeurmusique@gmail.com,"In the beginning, there was jack, and jack had a groove, and from this groove came the groove of all grooves. And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, jack boldly declared, let there be house. 

And house music was born. 

I am, you see, i am the creator, and this is my house, and in my house there is only house music. But i am not so selfish, because once you've entered my house, it then becomes our house and our house music... 

And you see no one man owns house because house music is a universal language spoke and understood by all. You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really, unless you're deep into the vibe of house. House is an uncontrolable desire to jack your body and as i told ya before this is our house, and our house music and every house you understand there is a keeper and in this house the keeper is jack. 

Now some of you might wonder, who is jack, and what is it that jack does? 

Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body. Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake. Jack is the one who give you the key to the wiggly worm. Jack is the one who learns you how you walk your body. Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all jackers together under one house. 

You may be black, you may be white, you may be jew, or gentile, it don't make a difference in our house, and this is fresh.

It's all about House Music

AJ Archibald,Chill/Mainstream,AJ Archibald,http://soundcloud.com/archybeatz,ArchyBeatz@yahoo.com,"I really do appreciate every play, like, comment and repost. I make music to express myself and my emotions. I've worked very hard for the last couple years of my life to get to the point I am at now. Every play, like comment and repost I get just shows me that my hard work is paying off. Thank you all very much.

I am a 21 year old from Akron Ohio. I have been working with audio and making instrumentals for a little over 3 years now. I believe I have my own unique style. I make the beats I want to make and the beats that please me and express my emotions and musical and technical talents to the fullest.

I am not one dimensional and love to venture into other different styles. My bread and butter is Reason 5, for producing music and Pro Tools 11 for mixing and mastering. but I have experimented with Sonar, Cubase, FL Studios and Logic X . I use a MPK88 to make my instrumentals. The music I listen to is unique as well.

Mainstream music today doesn't please my ears on most occasions.  That's why I find myself listening to older Hip-Hop/Rap, Under Under Underground Hip Hop, Soul and Jazz. I do listen to some mainstream artist such as J. Cole. As far as other producers, I admire The Alchemist, Jake One, Ant from Atmosphere. and J Cole, Black Milk, J Dilla and a few others. They all have their own style that no one can copy. 

I'm always down to work with other talented people who work hard and take ""this"" serious. So hit me up on SoundCloud Twitter  or my Email ArchyBeatz@yahoo.com

Ramón Daniels is part of a new wave of electronic music producers of the northwestern area of México, specifically from Tijuana where he is better known as Machino, he's been involved  in music for over 10 years, he started out in a punk band later  moving on to electronic based music. 

His tracks have been released by Highgrade Records, AMAM, Static Discos and Underyourskin Records, his style shifts back and forth between a very potent techno and a heavy ambient influence, but inevitably revealing an obscure side in his composition.  

His live set is a style hybrid of obscure and melodic house and techno.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ramón Daniels es parte de una nueva ola de productores de música electrónica en el norte de México, en la frontera entre Tijuana y San Diego. 

Su música ha sido editada en distintos sellos de reconocimiento dentro de la escena electrónica: Static Discos, Highgrade Records, AMAM, Glauben y Underyourskin Records. 

Lo de MACHINO oscila entre un fragmentado y potente techno que a veces se acompaña de profundos parajes ambientales, ritmos downtempo y guitarras etéreas. Sus sets en vivo se distinguen por una clara y nítida producción de sonido que devela un impulso intenso que es envolvente y arrollador.

2groove Music UK,Chill/Mainstream,Nick Jay & Hovey,http://soundcloud.com/2grooveofficialmusic2016uk,Twogroovemusicuk@yahoo.co.,"Made up of 2 friends named ‘Hovey’ & ‘Nick Jay’,originally coming from UKG/Bassline backrounds, 2groove have now opened up the House Music scene. Hailing from Yorkshire in Great Britain, they have their sights firmly set on breaking through the ranks and becoming main players on the House stage.

With their patience comes a lot of experience, having already played up and down the UK and also across Europe and now are looking to spread their sound across the globe.

In May 2014 , after 2groove teamed up with friends Disord3r to make their summer smash ‘Ready Or Not’ they experienced great success in the Beatport House chart, reaching a very impressive #12 spot which was fully charted. In response to this success they received considerable support from the likes of Justin Martin, Claude Van Stroke (Dirtybird) & Seth Troxler just to name a few.

 https://soundcloud.com/2grooveofficialmusic2014/fugees-ready-or-not-2014outnow

The love of music has truly prevailed for Nick & Hovey and this is reflected in what they are bringing to the House music scene. They are now running, again with their friends a brand new record label named ‘All Or Nothing Records’, in which they are releasing their own productions as well as other artists.

Kyro,Chill/Mainstream,Kyro,http://soundcloud.com/kyromusic1,sasha@vampmusic.com,"Originally starting out his career as a one-man speed metal band in the late-1930s, Sydney’s own pocket rocket Kyro, has been slowly making his mark on the Australian dance music scene. Like, literally… He actually keeps marking his territory everywhere he goes, it’s kinda nasty. Apart from this slightly insignificant bladder problem, Kyro has also caught the attention of DJs across the globe with his powerful electro house originals and remixes.
His production style balances armed to the teeth drops with soft & gentle break downs, influencing a broad range of styles from, electro/house, trap, twerk and also this new genre I just made up called 'mid-tempo future jazz'. 
His debut EP Space Cowboy was swiftly signed to Onelove Recordings in 2014. Collab Echo with A-Tonez skyrocketed to #1 on ARIA’s Club charts in 2015 and immediately gained international support from Marvin Garrix, Afrojake, David Guerra & Craig VonStroke.
After his Australia wide ‘Kyro Tour’ in mid-2014 cemented his worth, he teamed up with his Sexless-Lover A-Tonez, playing hugely successful shows & subsequently earning him enough frequent flyer miles to treat himself to a new winter snuggie.. Kyro’s also had the privilege of playing at some of Australia’s biggest festivals… etc etc yada yada are you still reading this? Wow. Congrats you made it to the end but there’s no deleted scenes or funny outtakes, sorry.
Long story short, Kyro's a legend. Get around him.

Lektrique, aka Vincent Sergeant, is a 25-year old electronic music producer from Belgium. He started DJing local parties at 15 and quickly fell in love with the European electro scene. In 2011, he relocated to Montreal, Canada where he linked up with at-the-time fledgling imprint Kannibalen Records. He first caught the attention of EDM fans in 2012, when “Jesus Christ”, his collaboration with label-mate Apashe, blew up on the Beatport Electro-House chart. Since then he’s released several well-received EPs and singles on Kannibalen Records. “Atomic”, co-produced with Australian artist Seek N Destroy, was a mainstay in 2014 electro sets worldwide.

Lektrique is also the host of the Kannibalen Radio Podcast, a bi-weekly mix series which has amassed a loyal following. Lektrique regularly premiers unreleased tracks by well-known and undiscovered electronic music producers. Lektrique has thus gained a well-earned reputation not only as an excellent producer, but also as a tastemaker with an ear for ground-breaking original sounds.

House Of Hustle came about in 2014 with a simple aim to promote house music with an attitude, not bound to a specific genre, more a general feeling of good vibes and pure party bangers. Our musical vision is not based on trends but rather a dope fusion of styles and a strong dedication to creatively evolve. We like it raw, dirty, and most important, we love seeing people go mental to the music we represent. Our love for the analogue sound, 808s, big basslines, sick melodies and naughty vocals most likely shines a light into
some of the elements that defines us. At the end of the day music is about uniting people and creating an emotional reaction, which is exactly what we are about, our Hustle Family is growing bigger on a daily basis and we have no
intention of stopping anytime soon. Our creative hustle is here to stay and together with our family we will continue breaking musical boundaries.

HELENA LEGEND,Chill/Mainstream,Helena Legend,http://soundcloud.com/helenalegend,info@prismprojects.net,"HELENA | DJ / PRODUCER / LEGEND

HELENA has it all: energetic DJ sets, on-point production, and a powerhouse of presence. Armed with such a deadly combination, the UK-born, Australian-bred and Los Angeles-based HELENA has taken the scene head on into unparalleled heights. HELENA dominates with her sound as one of dance music’s most prominent DJs and electronic producers. Showcasing her depth with electro, progressive and house beats she stands her ground with finesse. Proudly hosting a residency at the stunning Las Vegas 5,000 capacity super club Drai’s, the spotlight is at an all time high after releases on label giants such as Musical Freedom, Ultra Music, Sony, and Mutants Records to name a few.
With an array of new music on the horizon, HELENA has crafted a one-of-a-kind style in high demand. Signed in the USA with SPIN Artist Agency—home to artists such as Avicii, Oliver Heldens and Arty—2014 was a momentous year for the influential icon. 
This seminal journey continued at an absolutely torrid pace, with a hectic and busy touring schedule all over North America. HELENA went on to perform an electrifying set at Tomorrowland in Belgium, followed by in demand plays from Germany, to Canada, to Ireland, Tokyo and everywhere in-between.
Her debut single ‘Girl From The Sky’ shooting to No. #1 on the Australian Club charts for four weeks and with it a rapid rise to stardom. Her next major imprint was with the landmark release of ‘Levity’ feat. Shawnee Taylor, landing a Top 10 spot on Beatport. Dominating charts and festival stages alike this smash hit brought HELENA’s unique take on big-room to audiences everywhere. Released on Ultra, ‘Raven’ was her summer anthem, a huge monster track that shook clubs and festivals to their core. Additionally, her track ‘Legend’ gathered huge support from the likes of Hardwell, Nicky Romero, Ummet Ozcan, and R3hab. HELENA’s momentum progressed with no signs of slowing down, culminating in her previous single, ‘Shake It,’ out on Musical Freedom, which lead to guest mixes on Tiesto’s infamous ‘Club Life’ and with it exposure to new audiences all over the world. The newest track from HELENA out on Ultra February 6th and features the superstar vocalist Vassy from David Guetta’s track, ‘BAD,’ MTV proudly showcasing the worldwide premiere.

HELENA is on the path to becoming one of the world’s biggest talents. Her music, DJ sets, hard work, attitude and talent along with a strong social media following and hardcore fan base of ‘HELENA’s Legends’ has led to her touring all over including the US, Asia, Europe, and of course her home grounds, Australia. 

This queen of electronica has rocked festivals all over the world including Tomorrowland, Big Day Out, the Future Music National Tour, the main stages of Ultra Music Festival and Stereosonic as well as touring Asia supporting Alesso to sold out stadium crowds. With the respect and support of industry leaders around the globe as well as some of the biggest names in dance including Tiesto, Avicii, Hardwell, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, David Guetta, Bassjackers, and Firebeatz among many others, the distinction of being Pioneer Pro DJ’s most prominent ambassador, and a figurehead within the fight for cancer, HELENA has become one of the most watched names in music. Dubbed by DMC World Magazine as “one of the most exciting DJ’s of the moment,” this musical empress is without a doubt leading The Revolution; if you are not ready yet, be prepared for the HELENA takeover.

about///

Sinistarr is one of the leaders of the dance music new school, a triple-threat as a DJ/Producer and remixer who's as well known for his forward-thinking beats as he is for nightclub domination. Representing Detroit, Sinistarr's attacking both headphones and dancefloors for 2015.

If you know drum and bass you know Sinistarr as a respected junglist who's dropped heavyweight tracks over the years on Goldie's Metalheadz imprint, Doc Scott’s 31 Recordings, Hospital Records, Architecture Recordings and Renegade Hardware. Recently though, the man's been everywhere, applying his signature style to diverse sounds like footwork, techno and house with releases and remixes on SMOG, Tectonic, Human Elements, Seclusiasis, Juke Trax, and Loose Squares that show him moving beyond dance music conventions and constantly reaching out to a new audience. He’s even joined on as a member of the seminal group Urban Tribe, a team led by Drexciya member Stingray313 who boasts Carl Craig, Moodymann, and Anthony ‘Shake’ Shakir as other contributors.

From gigs at South By Southwest in Austin, Ohm (Tresor) in Berlin to the blue lagoons of Iceland, Sinistarr's been licking the envelope lately, and publications like URB, Vibe, Resident Advisor and Complex Magazine are taking note-- he is out in front.

How It Works:

1) Select the number of songs that you want mastered from our order form: monarchmastering.com/order

(All payments are made through Paypal)

2) Once payment is confirmed you will be automatically redirected to an upload form where you can upload your tracks in Wav. Format, and without limiters on the final master bus.

We just need the final master mix individual track (not each individual instrument track/stems)

3) We will master your songs ensuring that each one reaches its optimal potential. Our mastering process guarantees that your tracks can be up to par with modern tracks not in only in volume/thickness but in crystal clear clarity as well.

We also fix any phase issues to ensure your tracks playback consistency on every type of speaker whether it be an iPod, Car or a Club System.

The mastering process is necessary to release your tracks on Beatport, Itunes etc. or play your tracks in a live venue. Many labels also require your tracks to be mastered just to even be considered for release/demo submissions.

4) We will email you a secure, private download link from our personal Mediafire Server that will contain 2 versions of each song that you send to us (1 with commercial loudness and 1 with more dynamic range) in Wav. format, 24 bit quality.

5) You are guaranteed to receive your tracks within 48 hours of your upload.

If you need your tracks sooner order Expedited Mastering: monarchmastering.com/order-expedited-mastering

Twofold are an exciting dance music act brought to you by Adam Crewes-Meyer & Adam McKinney. Hailing from West Sussex (UK) & California (US) respectively, they certainly bring their own individual inspirations to the table. “We both felt that we wanted to push our music in the same direction” McKinney tells us. “Our collaborations under our other aliases were really fun and we were really pleased with the results we got. So when we both decided we wanted to make a variety of genres, the logical step was to create a new project”. The pair state that their new project isn’t primarily about specific genres, stating that they would be experimenting with all reaches of the Electronic Music spectrum. ""If a track contains the energy that gets a club moving, then I don't think it matters too much what the style is"" Crewes-Meyer says.

So what can we expect to hear from them? Twofold’s tracks have been described as ‘innovative, high energy club smashers’. But as with most things, you’ll really have to hear it to get a sense of it for yourself…

Bio:

       PartyWave is an emerging artist in forward-thinking bass music. Displaying a large range of styles in his production, his DJ sets are full of diversity and energetic vibes. His music carries an array of bass, melody, and a unique way of merging genres together to create a new, fresh sound. While being inspired by all ‘genres’ of music, his background brings in a fresh twist to his production. 
       Born and raised in San Diego, CA, his connection to the ocean and passion for surfing plays a vital role in his creative flow. Much like surfing, improvisation is a key asset that separates his style from other producers/DJ’s. Sharing the stage with a diversity of well known artists such as; Mr. Carmack, Hucci, Buku, Great Dane, G Jones,., (to name a few); PartyWave is now touring the nation and is a rising act on the festival circuit representing west coast bass music. Continuing to rise in the forward-thinking bass culture, PartyWave continues to produce fresh material on a consistent basis and is backed by some of the industry’s most influential blogs. With multiple west coast tours under his belt, eyes are on him with nation-wide and international bookings.

Gianni Blu is a DJ/Producer who has created a name for himself by fusing electronic and hip hop elements that are reflected in his original and remixed productions.  The 22-year-old (Italian/Haitian) producer has worked with artists such as Willy Joy, Lil Bibby, King Louie, Frenchie of Bricksquad Monopoly, Sasha Go Hard, and more. Over the past several years the Gianni Blu brand has been growing rapidly throughout the Midwest and the world. 

Fresh off a stellar show at Hong Kong’s nightclub “Levels”, Gianni Blu is anxious to expand his brand to new territories. Having just dropped a load of remixes including Fetty Wap’s “Trap Queen”, Future’s ”Commas” and Rich Homie Quans “Flex,” Gianni is swiftly becoming one of Chicago’s premier DJs. His original song “Feeling It” was recently released on NextGen Records and exemplifies his  production versatility from house to trap music. 

In addition to his international performances, Gianni has performed throughout the Midwest offering direct support for artists such as Ookay, Eptic, Elephante, and many more. He has captivated crowds in some of the biggest clubs and venues in the region including the Mid in Chicago, the Miramar Theater in Milwaukee, and the Skyway Theater in Minneapolis. 

Gianni began playing the violin and drums at a young age, and transferred his interests toward DJing and producing when his creative desires expanded past the boundaries of traditional instruments.  His multi-national background exposed him to music and cultures from all around the world that sculpted his eclectic style that’s so prevalent in his songs. His unique experiences give him the ability to provide exceptional assistance with music composition, artistic representation of the music, and songwriting, which is what he finds most appealing. With numerous songs getting prepared for release, Gianni Blu is planning to make 2016 an extremely explosive year.

With limitless energy, his trademark mane of jet black hair, and a passion for all things underground, Craig Williams has quickly built himself reputation as a musical tour de force both behind the decks and in the studio.

Hailing originally from Australia, Craig grew up playing bass and began DJing and producing 11 years ago.  Taking a wild detour from music, Craig spent several years working as a Black Hawk helicopter crewman in the Australian Army, which saw him deployed to Pakistan and East Timor. After his Army tenure came to a close, Craig held a residency at the popular Full Moon events in Queensland. With the desire to continue honing his music craft strong, he moved to Los Angeles, where he enrolled in the SAE Institute and earned a degree in audio engineering.

In recent years Craig has continued to shift the gaze of the industry in his direction.  His deft ability to produce both gritty  banging electro and underground techno has opened many doors for him, with releases and remixes for notable labels such as Dim Mak, Motorik, Relief, Perfect Driver, and many more.  2013 saw Craig release an EP with Bromance starlet Louisahhh!!!, as well as ""Paradise,"" a Beatport-charting collaboration with Chicago luminary Green Velvet which appeared on the legend's recent full length album Unshakeable.  Craig has also made an immediate impact with his skilled DJ sets, delivering memorable performances at Chicago’s legendary Lollapalooza, EDC in Las Vegas, and main stage slots at renowned club nights such Control Fridays at Avalon in Hollywood and Porn & Chicken at Evil Olive in Chicago. With forthcoming releases lined up on Sweat It Out and Discobelle, as well as collaborations in the pipeline with Gunrose, Sharooz, and Jencen Interceptor, 2014 is quickly shaping up to be a breakout year for Craig Williams.",5848,58,,,,,,9,raye@rada7.com

Joe and Josh Fortune, known as Twinz Beatz, are identical twins born in Newark, New Jersey but relocated to sunny Miami in their mid teens. This is where their passion for Hiphop drove them to experiment with a demo of a producing software. After creating hundreds of Hiphop tracks, they noticed their unique sound was heavily driven by Electronic Dance Music. In 2008 the Miami house scene was hard to ignore, and being that their music was so different from the current Hiphop sound at the time, they were intrigued to work with the rising ""Dutch House"" style. They quickly translated their profound touch into EDM, which spurred a new path for Twinz Beatz.

Now the rising talent of this duo is shaping the future of the electronic music revolution that's consuming all genres. Their current avenue is one that can be looked at as a trend, but to them the new genre of Trap/Trapstep is more like a gateway to the Hiphop vs EDM merge that they've been craving for. 

The Twinz strong eclectic approach on EDM mixed with their exhilarating high energy performances has made Twinz Beatz one of the most exciting upcoming DJ’s out the U.S. Their singles Kronos, Bass Gon Drop, and now Badman have been featured on Sirius XM Radio's BPM and Electric Area in regular rotation for the last year.  With remixes and direct support from Laidback Luke, Diplo, Knife Party, Zedd, and Hardwell, the twins are right where they need to be. Alongside this success, their own #TeamnoSleep club concept has evolved from a small social media idea to a driving force of fans devoted to Twinz Beatz and the love of EDM.

doshy,Chill/Mainstream,Robox Neotech // Saturate Records,http://soundcloud.com/doshy,promo@robox-neotech.com,"Bio
Long story short, I mostly make and play Bass Music in general such as Grime, Hiphop and Dubstep
I came up on the standard diet of HipHop, Turntablism, 80ties and 90ties Elektro, as well as lots of Dub, Jungle, IDM and world music, so I’ve got as many influences as anyone else I guess. But it took me a while to figure out what it was about the music I love, and really it’s just a certain vibe… The shit that grabs me most has always been wired mostly out of pitch but still danceable, it’s colorful and spacey but with lots late night energy, it’s dissonant and experimental and raw but still made for the clubs.
So that’s what I aim for when I’m making tunes or digging for them. I’m a producer  as well as a DJ as I started Djing and producing at the same time, but to be honest I can’t really say one or the other is more important to me. I love other people’s music too much to ever just play my own trax. But I also love producing, struggling to make that mythical perfect tune, you know? I know I don’t put out enough tunes, sorry about that… I’m working on it though. Even after all these years of producing I still feel like the new kid though, I’m still learning about music, and to be honest I hope that never changes.

Inquiries & Promos:&#13;
officialaboyandagirl@gmail.com

LA-based producers A Boy & A Girl are a recently formed duo who specialize in creating disgusting yet glittery bass music. Individually, Jon and Monica both have rich musical history and repertoire.

A Boy, Jon, has been predisposed to music his whole life; growing up in a household of classical russian musicians, he fully embraced his talents. Winning two concerto competitions and performing as the piano soloist with an orchestra didn't keep him from touring as the keyboardist in a hardcore metal band. Jon's start as a music producer began when he moved to LA where he started writing bass music for reality tv and movies.

A Girl, Monica, having numerous years of deejay experience and being former member of bass-heavy group Dirty Talk, is known in the truest sense as a ""Basshead"". Hailing from South America, she dominated the international scene with her electro and progressive house tracks before she formed Dirty Talk. Monica also attended Berklee College Of Music & McNally Smith College Of Music where she received a music degree in production and engineering.",8176,10,https://www.facebook.com/officialaboyandagirl,https://www.facebook.com/officialaboyandagirl,https://twitter.com/aboyandagirl,,,7,officialaboyandagirl@gmail.com

Bot is of the future. Half man, half-machine; fully Italian. Exiled in West London, locked in the studio since departing legendary duo Crookers, Bot (his creators named him Andrea Fratangelo) has disassembled any expectations and rebuilt his sound for 2018. 

Since forging his new solo path, Bot has prepared half a dozen releases to deliver throughout 2013. The first, ""Vamos / Go Down"" EP was hastily snatched by Steve Aoki's Dim Mak label and released in March. His 2nd release, 'Indastria 2028' followed in May on his own label Main Course (with partners Astronomar & Neoteric). Next up are 2 smashers for Blood Music (Trails/One Hour) which will see the light in July and have since debuted in Fake Blood's Fabric Live 69 compilation. To round out the year, Bot joins the crew at Southern Fried once again, to drop the ""Friday Pulse"" EP and remixes, featuring the legendary Robert Owens. On top of that, more music from Bot and friends is being prepared for Main Course, and he's stayed busy remixing the likes of Diplo & Wiley. One thing is for certain; there are no plans to slow down!

Futuristic techno and unorthodox club rhythms are welded with hip hop influences, and a nod to the sounds and sprit of classic house. What we have here folks, is the new tomorrow.",10098,92,http://www.facebook.com/bot106,http://www.facebook.com/bot106,http://www.twitter.com/bot106,http://www.youtube.com/user/bot106,"http://www.botishot.com

Top Billin Music,Chill/Mainstream,Top Billin,http://soundcloud.com/topbillinmusic,info@topbillinmusic.com,"Promos and demos: info@topbillinmusic.com

In 2006 Top Billin made themselves a household name in Helsinki with bootleg remixes, hot mixtapes and a monthly club night that was packed every single time from the beginning. Then came the first 12” ep and after that nothing was the same as the record was favored by club dj’s and party music lovers around the world.

The now classic first ep has later followed with more top selling EP’s and Top Billin has grown into smoothly running record label with a big back catalogue with artists ranging from US to Chile to Russia to Japan and beyond. Besides running the record label and crafting top-of-the-line club tunes, Top Billin has become a well oiled party machine, rocking shows around the globe from Paris to Berlin and Moscow to New York, with the biggest names in the business & countless other club favorites. In 2008 they even made their first big tour supporting M.I.A. on tour. 

The key to Top Billin’s success is not rocket science. They are just guys who love music and like to have good time. All the time. While they’re very serious about their music, Top Billin are definitely no genre-stuck. With their roots deep in house, hip hop, dancehall, boogie and even rock, Top Billin likes to keep their music up-to-date and cutting-edge, both in the shows they play and the records they put out. That’s why you can pretty much count on the latest Top Billin release to always provide you with fresh sounding club cuts, remixes and /or original productions, anything that they feel like at the time being.

Beside being club goers favorites, Top Billin and the label have made fans among big name dj’s like Diplo, Basement Jaxx, Skrillex, Todd Terry, Flosstradamus, Sinden, Laidback Luke, DJ Snake,  Drop The Lime, Claude Vonstroke, Steve Aoki, Cajmere, Dillon Francis, Brodinski, Major Lazer,  DJ Godfather, DJ Funk, DJ Vadim, Benny Benassi, even DJ Tiesto and countless more. 

The times being tough for anyone producing/selling music, Top Billin have no intention to stop, good music never grows old and electronic music has never been so good as it is now.

SPL,Chill/Mainstream,Sam Pool,http://soundcloud.com/spl,colin@mavenartists.com,"___________________________________&#13;
MGMT: <a href=""mailto:colin@mavenartists.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Colin (Maven Artists)</a>&#13;


___________________________________&#13;
&#13;
From his roots in the Drum and Bass movement, to the formation of his label Hollow Point Records in 2009, and now with the emergence of his trademark forward-thinking “Balearic Bass” sound, SMOG Records artist SPL stands poised to continue striking blows into the hearts and minds of EDM veterans and initiates alike.&#13;
&#13;
Sam Pool spent his early years in Oregon, studying music theory, piano, and drums; skills he would refine during a year abroad in Amsterdam, where he studied audio engineering.  His cutting edge fusion of styles balances equal parts reverence for musical history with restlessness for innovation.  Releases in the 2000's on revered D&B labels Barcode, Tech Itch, and Evol Intent set the stage for a switch in 2008 to Dubstep- a move that was immediately supported by releases thru industry giants Sub Human, Rottun, and Amorphous Music. No stranger to the upper echelons of the Bass Music universe, SPL has been remixed by some of the biggest names in the game: Bro Safari, UZ, Big Gigantic, and The Panacea.  His remixes for the likes of Bassnectar, The Glitch Mob, Downlink, and Dieselboy exhibit his diverse approach in production styles and genres.&#13;
&#13;
Combining arpeggio-heavy 90's era rave elements with his own brand of Heavy Bass music, SPL's “Balearic Bass” EP forthcoming on Smog September 3, 2013, showcases this virtuoso producer at his best. With over 100,000 Soundcloud plays in the month of July alone on his genre-bending, dance-floor leveling track “The Future”, a BBC Radio-One mix comprised of 100% original music, ThisSongIsSick.com’s premiere of his Balearic Bootleg series, and instant support on the “Balearic Bass” EP from UK tastemakers Skream, Benga, and UKF, the world at large is set to discover something the underground has known all along- that SPL has been, is now, and forever shall be a leader in the world of Heavy Bass Music.

Official #OnSoundcloud Premiere Partner

I've unfortunately had to remove all unofficial remixes from this Soundcloud. Follow my Yungcloud (https://www.hive.co/l/tyrmusic) where I will be re-uploading some of them! This is still primary account for all music. So stay tuned! Also check out my collective @TheCollxtion where I will be releasing a lot of my new music!

TYR pronounced tire (Rhymes with Fire) (Old Norse: Týr [tyːr]) is the god of single combat, victory and heroic glory in Norse mythology.

     Without the constraints of genre, most would crumble under the pressure of needing to please a widespread audience, but with the assistance of blogs and media distributors, TYR has become a household name as a solid producer and live electronic act.

     From tracks supported by Moby to virally popular remixes spreading far and wide on the EDM blogosphere, the foundation of TYR's fan base is incredibly strong. As his presence grows nationally and internationally, the crowds are ranting and raving about his high energy and diverse live set.

     Expect the best from this producer in 2015/16 as the 21 year old is just getting started. Driven by a deep passion for music and a need to play out as much as possible, few connect with a crowd like he does. TYR is one of the most progressive and eclectic producers and live performers in music today.

Profresher AKA Billy Blacklight is responsible for 'crunk-flavored beats' and 'neo-g-funk' basslines that set a bold stage for the crisp synth lines that cruise on top. Listening from beginning to end is like playing the PS1 Gran Turismo in a subwoofer-laden submarine while sippin' on some 'tussin. There's a late-90s throwback vibe throughout, as well as enough bass to make even the skinniest booty clap 'til dawn.

Algo the 20 year old Baltimore native has been on the come up for the past 5 years. He picked up drums at the young age of 14, and decided he wanted to further his ability to create full pieces of music by purchasing his first software. Having sustained injuries during his past career path in extreme sports he was layed up for 6 months with nothing but song ideas bouncing around in his head.Once healed up Algo then went on to try his hand at live performances by playing all sorts of various underground house parties and club shows in the heart of Baltimore city with the intention of paving his own sound of club standard music. Soon after he started making a name for himself by collaborating with fellow heavy hitting producers such as Getter, Trollphace, Dubloadz, and Jphelpz, he has truly started to find his own unique style and use it to his full advantage. One key element that he has always strived for is versatility, whether it be in his studio productions or live performances…he always aims to keep you on your toes with the next release. With music taste ranging from one end of the spectrum to the other...you never really know what you're going to get!

""The best thing to ever come out of Alaska” - Diplo 

Astronomar has been a stalwart in the US club scene for many years lending his production efforts to labels like Mad Decent, Fools Gold, OWSLA, Dim Mak, Slow Roast, BNR Trax, Enchufada, Ministry of Sound, Top Billin and his own label Main Course (plus remix work for countless other imprints) and gaining support from many of the industry's leading tastemakers like Diplo, Skrillex, GTA, Clockwork, Congorock, A-Trak, Zeds Dead and Martin Garrix, just to name a few. His massive remix of Wax Motif & Neoteric’s ‘Go Deep’ (Dim Mak) blew up in 2013 after nightly plays from Skrillex & Boys Noize, including Ultra Music Fest and 2 years in a row at Coachella; it was also included on Skrillex's 2013 Essential Mix for BBC Radio1! His 2013 Mutant Club EP [Main Course] drew support from A-trak, Congorock, Torro Torro, Salva and your favorite djs favorite dj. More recently, his 2015 Magic Potion EP [Main Course] has received support from the likes of Porter Robinson, Diplo, and many more. Needless to say, Mar is always a few steps ahead of the curve when it comes to new & exciting sounds. 2015 has been shaping up nicely as Astronomar has completed his second Australia tour, played EDC Las Vegas for a second time, and made his second appearance on BBC Radio 1's Diplo & Friends. When Mar isn't touring the US & Internationally, he stays busy as the head A&R of Main Course Records, which is without question the hottest new boutique label in club music.",29564,235,http://www.facebook.com/astronomar,http://www.facebook.com/astronomar,http://twitter.com/astronomar,,"http://dj.beatport.com/astronomar

Biography:

Sonic architects of songs with an emotional heft as heavy as the subwoofer rupturing basslines that underpin their work, Truth are one of New Zealand's finest creative exports. Respected across the globe, since inception several years ago, Truth (Andre Fernandez and Tristan Roake) have, as both world-class producers and party-rocking DJs, cut a clear pathway through the international dubstep scene.

On the nightclub and festival circuits, the fruits of their labor have included, several European tours, countless shows across the USA, New Zealand and Australia, an action packed South American tour, and shows in Asia.  Truth has built this performance presence through DJ support from Mala, Skream, Youngsta, Hatcha and N-Type, to name a few, giving their music an advance presence at key club nights like DMZ in London, Club Love in New York and through seminal radio stations such as BBC Radio One, Kiss Fm and Rinse FM.

Through keynote DJ support, they have been rewarded with single releases via Deep Medi Muzik, Tempa Records, Wheel and Deal, Blackbox Recs, Aquatic Lab, Disfigured Dubz, Argon and Boka Records. Through these, including critically 'The Fatman' (as released via Deep Medi Muzik) and their acclaimed Aquatic Lab released album Puppets, Truth have seen their stock rise, placing them as in-demand remixers and collaborators to The Nextmen, Miss Dynamite, Shapeshifter, The Black Seeds, Silkie, Kromestar, Tunndige,  Datsik and countless figures of note within the international dubstep community.
Acclaimed by critics both within and outside the dubstep scene, their momentum is undeniable and impossible to ignore. Face the truth or get well outta the way.

BoomBaptist has updated the classic 90's Boom-Bap formula developed by golden era hip-hop greats. Blending the old with the new, the Texas beat-maker has found his sound. Over a short period of time, recent RBMA participant, BoomBaptist has become a lead figure in the Texas electronic bass/beat scene, developing his own collective, ""Applied Pressure"". His invitations to baptize the world-famous ""Low End Theory”, Tokyo, and Bonaroo Music festival have cemented his position both locally and internationally as a front-runner in the new wave of forward-thinking electronic musicians. Peers consider BoomBaptist to be a sort of chameleon, shifting his music with the sound of today and paying homage to the foundation before him. His first vinyl was released recently on Fat Beats, a collaboration with the Detroit legend, Guilty Simpson. This year he also received music placements on Comedy Central’s “Broad City”, BBC radio, and NPR. BoomBaptist is busy preparing his debut LP with Feelin' Music due out this year. The future is bright for this young producer, keep eyes and ears open for BoomBaptist.",12468,130,https://www.facebook.com/BoomBaptist,https://www.facebook.com/BoomBaptist,http://twitter.com/boombaptist,http://www.youtube.com/user/andrewthaggard,"http://www.boombaptist.bandcamp.com

Management: tom@strike3.com.au

With her swift rise in the industry over the past twelve months, Kate Foxx has been hard at work earning her reputation as an energetic and driven talent - showing no signs of slowly down. Making the transition to touring artist and holding crowds in some of Australia’s best-known venues has come naturally: For this Foxx there is no better feeling than engaging the energy of the lively crowds she keeps; gaining their attention and holding it.

Through an authentic love of singing dating back as far as her first steps, there’s no surprise that vocal tracks are a key feature of each set. With strong elements of electro house, a love of feel-good vibes, plus a passion for providing a solid party; Kate Foxx blends genres and blurs the lines of commercial, classics and hidden treasures into main room performance seamlessly.

Already gaining attention on a global level, Kate’s debut feature with Bombs Away was released on international label Moon Records and featured on multiple compilations, while her ‘Ice Cream’ mix series is gearing towards one million plays worldwide across various platforms.

Whether she’s behind the decks or laying vocals in the studio, Kate’s raw talent and hard-working attitude are evident. Developing her songwriting skills and unique sound for the past two years, Kate is currently working on tracks with several established Australian producers, firmly planting her foot in the industry and establishing a future that’s bright for the ever-evolving Foxx.",10496,12,http://facebook.com/katefoxxmusic,http://facebook.com/katefoxxmusic,http://twitter.com/katefoxxdj,https://www.youtube.com/c/katefoxxmusic,"http://www.luckyent.com/artists/kate-foxx/

Dutch producer Lulleaux has quickly shown that he knows how to turn out red-hot remixes for some of the biggest names around.

Lulleaux first showed his musical potential when he was a child, learning piano and keyboard. From then on, the young man’s life was changed forever and music would always stay with him in some shape or form.

In 2013, he discovered production software and turntables, and mixtapes came and DJ gigs did too. In June 2014, Lulleaux remixed Anna Graceman’s ‘Words’ which brought with it one and half a million hits on SoundCloud. It even got picked up and praised by Norwegian hotshot Kygo.
Lulleaux’s debut release, ‘Up To You’ with FDVM, was released on Dirty Soul. After that highly successful debut effort, Lulleaux signed a deal with Sony. 

Now, Lulleaux has a collaboration with Sam Feldt lined up for release on Spinnin’ Records amongst others and he will be delivering remix goodness for mega stars like Benny Benassi, Claire, Ulf Nilsson, and Marlon Roudette on Ultra, Universal and Sony.

Soon to graduate from law school, Lulleaux is ready to blow everyone away with his own unique brand of house music.

Turno,Chill/Mainstream,Franko Moliterno,http://soundcloud.com/turnodj,jon@urbanagency.co.,"
'Time waits for no man.'  

...And this man has wasted no time!

Energetic, dedicated, passionate and fully self motivated by his hunger for success, this guy is setting new levels! 

With his latest project 'Hunger Games, Catching Fire' seeing him join forces with legendary players in the game; Skibadee & Shabba D (S.A.S). Right now Turno is really showing hunger for the game!  

“Turno, now cemented himself into the Drum & Bass fraternity with wiiiiiiiiiked music covering all aspects of the scene, taking his brand to new heights!” - Nicky Blackmarket (DJ) 

“I remember this guy handing me CDs with twenty tunes in dances. You could see the determination and passion within him back then and you just knew that one day he was going to be a regular face within the Drum & Bass scene. Turnos commitment is next level and his hard work is now paying off as you can hear in your latest productions where he’s stepped right up. I’m pretty sure that with his versatility and drive he’s got so much more to come.”  - Majistrate (DJ/Producer/Label Owner) 

“Turno is one of the leading names of the new generation of Drum & Bass artists, both as a first rate producer and a DJ that entertains the crowd… this is why he has become a resident at our events.” – Bridge (Def:inition & Breakin Science)

Having the full support and encouragement from some of the biggest players in the Drum & Bass scene, Turno is eternally grateful. After studying Music at College, attending University to study Music Technology and investigating the scene as much as he could – it really has spun him some favours. As much as he deserves every part of his success so far and the backing he has, he has a respectable, humble approach to his career. With his positive attitude having the biggest part to play in his success, Turno truly believes that you can have anything in life if you’re willing to work for it, and never stop until you have it. “I would rather try and fail than fail and have never tried”, says Turno - a quote that we should all live by if we believe we want something enough. Not being shy of hard work, Turno knows that nothing will happen in life unless you make it. Turno’s attitude to his life, career and overall genuine belief in never stopping until you have what you want, is truly inspiring.

Starting his DJ career early on at the age of fourteen, Turno was forced to choose Music Technology as an option at School after all the other subjects were taken. Little did he know back then this was probably the best decision of his life.
Like most DJ's Turno started out with the very basics. Initially, starting his career by mixing with a pair of IMG Stage Line Belt Drive turntables in 2003 after buying them from a friend, along with five to six vinyl’s that saw Turno repeatedly play to practice his mixing technique. With the likes of 'Addicted to Bass' by Pure Tone and 'Keep ya Heads Ringing' by Dr. Dre constantly being blasted out by Turno (this is one of the few times that he would openly admit himself that he clanged his way through a set!), its no wonder his Mum went out and bought him something new to play, and these were to be the first drum & bass vinyl records that Turno would own; 'Blandwagon Poo's' by John B and 'Torture Chamber' by Friction.  These two records alone potentially part created the artist that we now have in Turno.

Turno had set his goals high from the off. He never doubted how successful he would be; he knew with the right work ethic and correct attitude – he would undoubtedly get to where he wanted to be. When looking at his inspirations at the time, the likes of Hazard, Twisted Individual, G-Dub, Pleasure & Sly – these all had a big part to play in Turno’s mould, without them even knowing it Turno was quickly infiltrating himself into the same sub genre and little did they know that he would come through as quick as he has. 
Hazard, for Turno, was the biggest motivational DJ/Producer that had the most influence on Turno. Perhaps not his mixing technique – Hazard has more structural definition on his beat matching, Turno emulates but through a different style of mixing; known for his robust, high energy sets with frequent edits to keep the listener engaged through drops that see him go through tune after tune after tune! When you experience a Turno set, you really feel that he has explored his genre well! 
The beautiful thing about Turno is that he genuinely loves the people; he creates a journey for the listener. He reaches out with his music because he wants to intrigue people with his sound. Seeing the reaction to people listening to his music is what has really pushed him to move forward, this is why he started making beats in the first place; the people. Turno is a born entertainer, he is a performer and if you meet him, you will know why – his pleasant, respectful demeanour is enhanced with his quirky humour and playful antics. 

With his first 12” vinyl release back in 2011 on CKB’s label - Class A Recordingz. The aptly named ‘Dreams’ (B side - Eagles Claw) fast became hot property on the scene. Turno knew then that this was his mapped out path; his forte, and realised that maybe fate had a hand to play when dishing out the options at school. Since the release of Dreams, Turno has produced a variety of tunes, remixes and collaborated with MC’s and DJ’s in the drum & bass scene, who he only once dreamed about working with. These have included; Dominator, Logan D, Sly, Majistrate, Pasco, Levela, Jaydan, Annix, Dubmotion, Profile, Caski, Ruffstuff, Friller, Voltage, Stormin, Trigga, Spyda, Zedo, Fun, Skiba & Shabba - to name a few! With releases on Shadow Demon Records like ‘No Jokin’ feat. MC Trigga, Sly & Pasco feat. David Boomah ‘Bad up the town’ (Turno remix) and more recently released on Low Down Deep Recordings; a remix of Pasco’s ‘Release the Hounds’, it’s a no brainer why Turno is the new generation of sort after producers for old and new music heads alike. 

“Turno has been making waves in the D&B scene for a few years now and as we are big fans of his music we thought it was about time he made something for our label. Now, Turno is probably best known for his more Jump Up style tracks, so we asked him to try something different, something that might fit the Serial Killaz ethos.  What we didn’t expect was this disgusting slice of filth. Utilising old skool samples, ragga vocals and a militant bass and drum work out, this one – quite rightly – has already grabbed the attention of Hazard, Bryan G and Randall, with many more to follow. This will make up part of his forthcoming E.P. on our very own Serial Killaz imprint, and will be available early next year”.  - Serial Killaz UK (Turno - Badman Nah Beg Fren’ )

When asked on what Turno thought was his biggest achievements to date were…… he really couldn’t define just one, “it’s so hard to pick just one from the many I feel I have”.  Spoken from someone who genuinely feels blessed to have had the experiences he has had so far. So, after narrowing down the list, Turno thought to mention the achievements he felt had had the most impact on him personally. First and foremost, “Being able to do music full time” – Turno, after 2 years since his first release, was able to turn to music full time and handed his notice in working as an insurance executive for his Dad’s business. “I could’ve worked my way through the business to one day run it, but this isn’t what I wanted, I wanted to create my own legacy”, spoken from a truly dedicated music man and someone that wants to create his own path in life. 
Next on the achievement list is DJ Hazard playing ‘Badman Nah Beg Fren’ at Warning in October 2014, ‘Man was FULLY gassed’ says Turno, “seeing someone you have been self-encouraged by for the last 5 years play your tune is indescribable!”
Playing at Zoo for Sunbeatz Ibiza and being asked by Mickey Finn and Darren Jay to present the last two Sunbeatz promotional videos. Yellow Night that was selected by Grooverider on Radio 1 as his ‘rewind track’ in August 2011, Elements Festival (Belgium), and more recently; a fifteen minute guest mix for Crissy Criss (Radio 1xtra) alongside being invited to his last show as the only up and coming Jump Up artist in attendance…… the list could go on! 
Turno says that the one thing that made him realise he has worked his way through and is coming up as planned, is when he put forward an idea of a project to Skibadee and Shabba and they agreed to record a studio mix with him. This moment defined him not only as a DJ/Producer, but it was a personal moment of validation - that he had made the right choices so far.  

“Before I listen to this, I’m glad Turno got to step & select for this, as I believe he’s got the attributes to be around for the next 10 years!” – Harry Shotta (MC)

With Turno only being on the scene since 2011, it’s refreshing to know that in three years you really make an imprint in to the scene when you have the right way about you along with the bags of talent (and dubplates) like Turno has. 
He has already smashed his way this far through the Drum & Bass scene it questions as to what Turno at only 25, will do next?! 
Now he has moved on from his IMG Stage Line Direct Drives and has glided forward with technology, expect big things from Turno! He has a lot under his Gucci belt already, let alone what is set to come…. Like his Italian heritage, he is passionate, distinctive and always has more to give! Anticipate Turno to be a household name in the scene for many years to come because he is bringing his brand to eventually take over the world!  
Expect more from Turno Tours with up and coming media specialist ‘Limelight T.V.’, more collaborations with big artists, future releases on various labels, a new venture ‘Your Time is Now’ which see’s Turno put back into the scene in a different way. Turno has plans for his own label which should be up and running by the middle of 2015 and his own clothing label that is being worked on already…. This guy really is creating his brand and bringing it to the forefront, his ‘Time Is Now’.

Starting his most recent alias OmegaMode a mere one and a half years ago, he has been gaining followers at an astonishing rate. To say that his tunes speak for themselves would be an understatement. With a potent armada of Alien like signature growls, drones, and constantly evolving metallic tones, OmegaMode is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with bass music - and the world has been listening. Artist support from Getter, Borgore, Skrillex, and countless others has proven these meticulously crafted tracks to be more than capable of destroying any crowd, and the mountain of positive feedback on his social media accounts is a sure sign that OmegaMode is here to stay.

BIO :
The Dandi & Ugo duo is born from a strong friendship
 and a great passion for techno music.
 It is their native land (Romagna) that takes them to frequent and,
 successively, perform in Rimini and Riccione's clubs
 in their most magic period (beginning of 90s).
 After a decade of DJ sets in clubs
 such as, among others,
 Echoes Liz Club / Cocorico' / Pascia' /
 Ecu / Peter pan / Classic Club / Madame Butterfly,
 they decide to switch to  production thus starting a new adventure
 that takes them to realize records,
 initially with prestigious Italian labels
  ( Re&gt;&gt;Vox records / Stereo Seven Plus Records )
 and next european labels
( Lasergun / Great Stuff / LuxaFlex records /
 Artminimal Berlin / Sammeplantz / Immigrant )
 with a big success with creations from artists such as
Rchie Hawtin/Len Faki
 Mihalis Safras / Florian Meindl / Marc Houle /
 Gregor Tresher / Someone Else
 / Xpansul / John Aquaviva /
 Martin Eyerer / Butch / Mauro Picotto / Markantonio /
 Joseph Capriati / Claudio Coccoluto / and many others.
 In 2006, together with Alessandro Piatto ( N.O.I.A / Klein &amp; Mbo)
 they decide to open their own label.
 This starts the birth of ITALO BUSINESS RECORDS,
 a project divided into 4 parts:
 vinyl, net label, digital download and booking agency.
 The discovery of new artists worldwide,
 and the support of internationally known DJs
, makes of this label a referring point for the Techno movement.

In 1997 a group of friends from Nottingham with a passion for House Music began hosting events called Kinky Movement in and around the area, firstly at the Skyy Club, which later became the Blueprint and also venues such as the legendary Bomb, Dubble Bubble and The Edge. 

As well as running their own events they also played at the events and free parties of epic sound systems Smokescreen and Diy who are still going as strong today as they were 20 years ago.

After many years of Dj’ing and promoting Kinky Movement members Andrew Mcloughlin Lee Eden and John Symms took the natural progression into Music production. Their first release came back in 2004 on Tango Records. Since then they have gone on to work with well over 50 different labels from around from around the globe and released over 200 original tracks and remixes on labels such as Salted Music, Large Music, Swing City, Drop Music, King Street, Nitegrooves, Jalapeño, Erase Records and their own imprint Replay Recordings.

On the back of their very impressive discography they have been booked to play in over 20 different countries such as Australia, New Zealand, U.S,Russia, South Africa, Bulgaria, Belgium, Georgia, Ukraine just to name a few.

Today, as well as regularly touring Kinky Movement currently hold Dj residences in Nottingham and Bristol and soon to be Japan which is where John has settled recently.

In 2015 Kinky Movement made it in the Traxsource top 100 artists of the year in two genres with a succession of big releases on labels Salted Music, Large Music, Erase records.

With many new releases in the pipeline and recently being signed to the Foundation artists roster, 2016 is looking like it's going to be an exciting year for the Kinky Movement trio.

MAN RECORDINGS / LAMAt rec. / 
LATINO RESISTE

One of the most interesting up and coming producers now is the Czech native operating in Peru under Chong-X.

Chong-X has started with his own music production in the early days of 1996 in ragga - jungle style. (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/chongx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chongx</a> ) That led him in 2000 to now nonexistent Aphrikka sound system, where he became regular performer, most often in tandem with DJ Mad4ce. His production on the Czech scene gained fame mainly through his novel remixes, many riddims and by the original dubstep or variations of classical Jamaican standards.

In 2005, the Aphrikka sound system transformed into Roots 'n' Future collective, with which Chong-X continued his successful live performances. A few years ago, his interested began moving towards the Tropical, Global Bass and just recently to Moombahton, integrating both into its production, and into his DJ set.

In 2010, along with his equally talented fellow producer http://soundcloud.com/don-pedropoulos based digital label, Lamat Records, which focuses on the fusion of local traditional genre with the current sound of European dance floors - Global Bass, Tropical, Moombahton. The first feat of the label appeared in the April 2011 split E.P. titled ""Hulk Attack"" on two tracks from both producers.

Biography
From the early career stages in an Amsterdam attic studio to being called “a breath of fresh air”, “producers to watch”, and “future superstar DJs”, the importance of commitment and patience is once again underlined by the prime example presented right before your eyes: ANOTR.
Consisting of 21 year olds Jesse van der Heijden and Oguzhan Guney, ANOTR are the house-meets-techhouse revelations of their time. 
After hours and hours of hard work and tweaks to reach undisputed perfection, the first eye-opening works of the Amsterdam based sparked the interest of record label Armada Music, subsequently leading to the release of summer anthem ‘Strobe’ on Defected records breakout label DFTD in early October 2015.

Despite their tender age, ANOTR have played on summer festival hotspot Ibiza, rewarded their fans with multiple DJ performances during Europe’s main dance music conference Amsterdam Dance Event, and graced plenty more internationally acclaimed clubs, venues, and festivals with their distinctive sound, and unmatched, on-stage energy.
With plenty of remixes, EPs, and experimental compositions looming on the horizon, the vast expansion of ANOTR’s foothold in Electronic music territory had already begun. Where and if it will end, nobody
knows. But once thing’s unmistakably certain. ANOTR are fresh, consistent, and more than sufficiently talented to aim for music world domination.

ABSTRACT SOURCE BIO

Jules has carved his current sound from years of travel, studio engineering and DJing. He has garnered an array of technical skills from a live, acoustic and analogue production background, developed in the digital realm then acid tested on dance floors around the world.

Covering many bases from Disco to Detroit Techno,  he continues to push the boundaries of Electronic Music while maintaining an old school approach to production. Combining vintage drum machines, analogue synths and state of the art plug-ins fired through a 5 foot analogue rack (courtesy of mix wizard - Wes Maebe). 

A genuine passion for travel and music has taken Jules all over the world on both a professional and personal basis, relocating to Kuala Lumpur in 2003 and eventually setting up DJ/Producer courses at SAE (School of Audio Engineering). 

Jules currently works in London as a production tutor and producer focusing on recording and producing live musicians, which has helped add an organic angle to his productions.

I make weird tunes.

Typically the bio is written in 3rd person but...
HI. I'm Rezz. I'm 20 years old. I started producing in november of 2013 & pretty much haven't left my computer since. I use ableton 9. It was rocket science at first but nothing 14 hours a day can't fix. Some of my musical influences are deadmau5, gesaffelstein, alesia, amon tobin, eskmo, bassnectar, pretty lights & tons more that i'm likely forgetting. I will eternally give tunes away for free despite signing to SOME labels that cross my path because I want to treat all humans to a delightful first impression. I love & appreciate life and hope the same for you. I'm also obsessed with dogs. Hope u like my music : )",25866,68,,,,,,3,Jonathanc@2plustwo.comAdam@2plustwo.comCody@amonly.comMadi@amonly.com

 - Self Taught
 - Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia

I used to play all different types instruments as a kid.. I played trumpet, clarinet, piano & sax. Even though I couldn't read music that well, I used to memorise all the songs by just listening to them. I then discovered electronic music and haven't looked back.

I love learning and discovering new things... It is now my life and I am giving it my all to make a successful career out of it.

Bio:
The duo from Rome praise a career full of radio hits and first class productions. Nazario Pelusi and Fabio Ranucci have been around for over 10 years, on national radio stations and with a catalogue of more than 30 productions under the Promise Land name, half of which published worldwide.
Their talent is reverted in studio, with sounds ranging from sexy house, to progressive groove and occasionally electro, that caught the attention of names like TIËSTO, Steve Angello, Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, Hardwell, Fedde le Grand, Sander van Doorn, Erick Morillo just to name a few.
Some of the best labels worldwide released their music: SIZE (“Why I still Love You” and “Bad DJ”), Spinnin’ (“Gangsta”, “Rulez” and “Alarma”), DOORN (“VEGA” and “NOISE”, with Junior Black), Flamingo Recordings (“Allright”), Mixmash Records (“Faithfully”) and Smash The House (“Memories Will Fade”), they worked together with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike (on ""Alarma""), Chuckie (on “Burn” and ""Breaking up"", which stayed in the Beatport top 100 main chart for months) and remixed for artists like Swedish House Mafia (""Don't you worry child""), Kelly Clarkson (""What Doesn't Kill You""), Emeli Sandè (“Daddy”), and several great remixes for the very talented Loreen.

More recently they released “Let The Groove” on Kryder’s Sosumi label and a new big release on DOORN/Spinnin’ is coming up, which is being premiered by two industry heavyweights, who already gave great support to Promise Land and their music.
Their musical creativity has strongly overcome the European boundaries and had them travel to the States, where they did a couple of very successful tours in the States, including Webster Hall a.o. and a great tour in Asia, including Zouk Singapore, Zouk Kuala Lumpur and CUBIC. Promise Land also performed at Tomorrowland Belgium (2013, 2014 and 2015), Creamfields, Lief Festival and venues like Privilege, Pacha, Gatecrasher, Altromondo Studios, Setai and Maydan Beach.

CRIN3S, known in his daily life as Cristiano, is a 18 years old, Portuguese and Swiss DJ/Producer. Despite having come in contact with music from a really young age, he never took music classes. Cristiano spent his time listening to Portuguese pop-music and recreating them on his keyboard. Because of this, the characteristics of typical melodic Portuguese music can be found in his tracks. 
When he came across electronic music, he became fascinated with the genre and has already collaborated with huge names within the scene. In 2014, CRIN3S has released the track ‘’FREEOLOGY’’ on the world-renowned record label Tiger Records. Moreover, he can be found on large festivals as well as smaller club nights, where he will unleash his melodic and pumping tracks throughout the speakers.",5728,21,,,,,,1,sbooking@gmail.comspromo@gmail.commarco.kraehenbuehl@globalvisions-events.ch

You hear his name everywhere - whether in hushed tones in dark corners of the web, or on the lips of the biggest producers in DNB - the prodigy known as NICKBEE, who's natural talents and standout productions have made him one of electronic music's best kept secrets.

Inspired by the likes of The Prodigy, Noisia, Bad Company UK, and Black Sun Empire, NickBee (real name Nick -----) started producing drum & bass at age 15. One year later he began learning to mix. Within 3 months, he was debuting his skills in clubs. Flash forward five years and countless hours sitting at his PC, NickBee is a rising star in the European drum and bass scene. As a young producer, Nickbee has collaborated with the likes of Enei and Billain, while releasing music on highly respected labels like Horizons Music, Close 2 Death, Dispatch, and TAMRECORDS. An impressive record for a 21 year old. Oh - and he's got forthcoming material on Bad Taste and Noisia's Invisible imprint, to boot.

With one foot set in the future and another amongst neurofunk DNB's architects, Nick's trademark sound is not easily classified. Morphing, animalistic basslines project through sonic space in perfectly organized chaos, with structure provided by painfully sharp drums. Never conforming to any set mold, Nickbee's allegiance to innovation makes a quirky, experimental element a defining factor of his music. Perhaps most impressive is the young artist's mastery of next-level sound design, which is never forced or overdone; only tastefully applied in careful amounts, always striking that perfect balance of hi-tech and low-fi…a skill reserved only for experts. As this producer continues to defy formula and rewrite DNB's blueprint, it becomes clear that only one word can adequately describe this future sound of drum & bass… NickBee.",11307,57,http://www.facebook.com/NickBeeAudio,http://www.facebook.com/NickBeeAudio,http://twitter.com/NickBeeAudio,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpvJ6wpTapxRcPPKwubfNJQ,"http://nickbeemusic.com/

Juventa is one of the new-breed of super talented DJ/Producers in the scene unrestricted by genre boundaries, who at every turn continues to amaze and entertain with his studio output and DJ performances that most artists could only dream of being able to achieve at such a young age.

With his first release at just 15 years old, Juventa quickly established himself thanks to diverse productions and remixes across leading labels such as Enhanced Music, 5 x World Number 1 DJ Armin Van Buuren's very own Armada Music imprint in Holland, scene legends Above & Beyond's Anjunabeats and even appearances on the likes of Disney, as his constantly evolving sound continues attract new fans to his fresh take on EDM.

Now just 21 years old and with an army of A List DJ fans, Juventa has also seen serious air time on the likes of the UK's leading radio station BBC Radio One, and in the USA on Sirius XM with stand out hits such as 'The Strip', 'Bitsmash', '405' & his recent collaboration with vocalist Erica Curran: 'Move Into Light'. The aforementioned 'Move Into Light' has without question been his biggest hit to date, topping the dance charts in summer 2013 and the official music video racking up hundreds of thousands of views in a matter of days since it release. In addition to his own hits, he's been commissioned by none other than Above & Beyond for no fewer than three remixes on their Anjunabeats label, and has also remixed the likes of trance superstar Dash Berlin and the USA's leading duo Tritonal. Such work has gone on to establish him as a key name with the ability to put a star turn on any release.

Over the past few years Jordin's style has developed in the most modern sense - whilst maintaining the melodic edge, a more progressive big room flavour has caught the ears of the biggest DJs on the planet, as he infuses genres to create his own unique 'Juventa' sound, and a sound that has made him in high demand across the globe as fans flock to see him perform live, from the likes of megaclub Home in Sydney, Australia, to Korea for The World DJ Festival in Seoul and the USA for Lucky Festival in Seattle. And the list doesn't stop there, where amongst a long list of career highlights he's also rocked the world famous Ministry Of Sound in London UK, and the 30,000 strong A State Of Trance in his homeland The Netherlands.

A certified star at 21, and it's only just begun for Juventa!

Arian Hagen,Chill/Mainstream,Arian Hagen,http://soundcloud.com/arian_music,arianmusik@gmx.de,"Minimal Classic, Trip-Hop, Ambient and Beats.

Arian Hagen (* 07.01.1994) is a composer/producer from Halle (Germany). His sound is a mix between classical pieces and atmospheric electronic compositions. Influenced by musicians like Radiohead, Massive Attack, Burial, DJ Premier, Flying Lotus, Clint Mansell and Philip Glass (etc.), Arian composes minimalistic melodies. Typically you will hear him lay down slow and driving drumbeats with precise additions of electronic sounds. The easiest featured part about Arian's compositions is his minimalist piano pieces. After sharing his music on Soundcloud he quickly got a following. Later he was chosen as the ""Soundclouder Of The Day"". 
In 2013 he released his first album (""The Meaning Of It All""). It features some of his Soundcloud friends and a artwork by the indian 
artist Archan Nair. Recently he concentrated on producing conceptual EPs.

LESWARE.DJ@GMAIL.COM


DJ / PRODUCER

Lesware is a wildcard. A dark shadowed enigma that pokes his head to the surface only to release a myriad of synthesized, compressed power, then recluses, and gets right back to doing what he does best.

Fueled by countless cups of Brazilian coffee and Nandos Extra Hot Double Classic Chicken Burgers, the fruits of Leswareʼs labors are starting to appear in more sets, heard on more floors, and are rupturing more speaker cones.

His name was planted on the lips of many when his remix of dance anthem ʻTricky Trickyʼ began tearing clubs apart, racking up hundreds of thousands of online plays, and securing him a legion of fans.

He followed up this newfound success with a spate of releases, both original and remixes, cementing himself as a heavy hitter of the industry. He later reached the number 11 spot on the highly revered ARIA Club Chart with his ʻWassup!ʼ EP, which dropped via Hype Records.

His hard work ethic granted him the opportunity to play at Stereosonic & Future Music Festival, and with upcoming releases on Ministry of Sound & Onelove, the reclusive, enigmatic Lesware is about to become very talked about.",14364,32,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lesware/259129747451045,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lesware/259129747451045,http://twitter.com/lesware,https://www.youtube.com/user/LeswareOfficial,,8,JAMES@LTMCREW.COMLESWARE.DJ@GMAIL.COM

Tropkillaz is a duo formed by Brazilian producers, from the old school (DJ Zegon) and new school (Laudz).

Dj Zegon is one of Brazil’s most respected DJ/Producers – with a career spanning over 20 years, and having worked in over 100 records,including collaborations with Kanye West, M.I.A, David Byrne(Talking Heads), George Clinton,a few Wu Tang Members (RZA,Method Man,Ol’Dirty Bastard) amongst others. Former member of the group N.A.S.A, he toured the world with their debut album “The Spirit of Apollo” and performed in festivals such as Coachella.

Laudz is a new cat in the game, however even with only 5 years in the business he’s worked with the likes of like Snoop Dogg,Dr Dre, as well as Brazil’s top hip hop MCs.  The two have also scored movies,comercials and tracks for videogames .

Together, the two have created an intense collection of club bangers,that blends Trap and Bass music with Electro,Hip Hop, and Latin Samples in a unique style.

They first got worldwide attention with their underground hit “Mambo”, a sure shot in any dance-floor, and their recent collab  ”Assets” with Yellow Claw (released by Mad Decent) propelled them even further, placing Tropkillaz’s footprint in the Trap Movement.

Being recently featured on Run The Trap’s Top 10 Trap Duos (tastemaker blog in the scene – run by Complex Music), having their remix of N.A.S.A’s “Hide” on the Top 10 iTunes Electronic Charts (US & UK), official remixes for Major Lazer, and with recent support from superstar DJs like Diplo, Flosstradamus,DJ Snake,Steve Aoki, to name a few, Tropkillaz have proved to be heavy-weight contenders.

With over 50 original tracks and remixes ready, and having performed sold out shows in venues ranging from Brazil to Russia, Tropkillaz is currently finishing a mixtape entitled “Tropical Bass Killers”, as well as their debut EP.  Watch this space.

TMSV,Chill/Mainstream,Tomas R,http://soundcloud.com/tmsv,tmsvmusic@gmail.com,"tmsvmusic@gmail.com for Bookings/Inquiries/Remixes/Sending me tunes

Firmly established in the dubstep scene for several years, Tomas Roels, better known as TMSV, has decided to switch things up. After taking a few steps back from the music scene to experiment and search for a new sound to call his own, his latest output takes inspiration from jungle, grime, juke, dubstep and other bass music. No longer constrained by genre or tempo, TMSV’s sub-powered, percussive dread music is diverse, yet recognisable. 

Aside from being a producer, TMSV is a perfectionist behind the decks and has torn up dancefloors at renowned club nights in Europe and beyond. Not a fan of single-genre sets, he likes to play the wide range of sounds he’s into.

2016 is set to be a big year for TMSV, with numerous high-profile solo releases as well as remixes on various labels.

Nature sounds,Chill/Mainstream,Tai,http://soundcloud.com/nature-sounds,Tai.inoue@my.jcu,"A life long lover of nature and constantly intrigued by the natural world and the invisible world of sounds that surround us. This has taken me on a journey of trying to combine my love of exploring and documenting nature with my passion for recording and understanding sound. The idea has since manifested into a number of interesting projects and is in a constant state of evolution. I like the idea of using art as a way to understand the world of science, using imagination to explore scientific ideas beyond the limits of traditional scientific methodology.

I have built up the gear to record and capture sounds for use in films, interviews and music projects or you can check out the library of sounds. I have worked on a number of film projects in a number of different roles and enjoy working behind the camera, which has helped how I work with sound. I like being able to provide a different point of view and unique service for people who like the idea of thinking outside the box, because I live outside the box. 

The most profound sound you will ever hear, is the sound when your heart breaks open

If you like these recordings and would like more information please feel free to contact me on Tai.inoue@my.jcu.edu.au

Thanks Tai

BIOGRAPHY
Daniel Morales, más conocido como Daniel Madison, es un joven deejay y productor originario de Bogotá (Colombia) y afincado en España.

Daniel comenzó sus andaduras como deejay con residencias en varias salas de Madrid, ciudad que le ha visto nacer y crecer en la industria.

A la vez que deleitaba a toda la capital con su inimitable estilo y su gran gusto musical, Daniel se formaba como productor, y comenzaba a lanzar sus primeros singles con sellos de todo el mundo.

En 2012, fue el ganador del concurso Maxima Fm Winner Dj, premio que le otorgaba el lugar de mejor Dj amateur del país.

A raíz de este gran éxito, Daniel Madison,  con tan sólo 20 años, consigue algo que sin duda cualquier deejay y productor desearía, un contrato discográfico con uno de los Big Labels más reconocidos internacionalmente: Warner Music.

Tras semejante salto de calidad, las radios más importantes del país se hicieron eco de esta nueva estrella emergente, incluyendo a Máxima Fm, que no dudó en añadir varios de sus singles a sus charts.

Los mejores clubs del país, así como varios festivales, no tardaron en incluir al artista en su programación, destacando, sin duda, sus residencias en algunas de las salas más prestigiosas de Madrid como Joy Eslava, en la que el artista goza de una residencia semanal, o Teatro Kapital, que ha bailado al ritmo de Daniel Madison durante todo el verano de 2015.
Artistas de talla mundial como Steve Aoki o Juicy M  han sido algunos de sus compañeros de cabina durante la última temporada.

A día de hoy, después de una más que exitosa gira por toda España y cientos de actuaciones a sus espaldas, Daniel se consolida como una de las jovenes promesas de la música electrónica.

En 2016, Daniel Madison nos deleitará con un nuevo álbum completo en el que su inconfudible estilo mainstream no dejará a nadie indiferente. Muy pronto, el artista nos dará un adelanto con los 2 primeros singles del álbum.",8681,17,https://www.facebook.com/danmadisonmusic,https://www.facebook.com/danmadisonmusic,https://twitter.com/DANMADISONMUSIC,http://youtube.com/user/channel/UC9knUQV15uVS9VoP-gbyqdg,,14,management@danielmadisomusic.com

»If music be the food of love, play on.« William Shakespeare

Born in Munich Alex has been surrounded by music since before he could even walk. His grandfather was a jazz music producer and wanted his grandson to follow suit in his career. A young Alex began taking music classes at the age of 6, when it became clear to see that his grandfather's musical talent had been passed on to his grandson.

After dabbling with different instruments from childhood to his early teenaged years, he contracted true passion for electronic music. With only a dream to make it and a deep appreciation for music, Alex Brandt started his journey...",17572,34,http://fb.com/alexbrandtmusic,http://fb.com/alexbrandtmusic,http://twitter.com/alexbrandtmusic,http://www.youtube.com/alexbrandtmusic,,2,alxbrandt@gmail.com

This auditory entity was sequenced into the DNA of a mushroom spore, then propelled through time and space on a trajectory for Planet Earth.  Upon arriving on our planet, the spore germinated in the form of Earth music, bringing its intricately coded information to us through precisely arranged sound and vibration.  Representing the bio-mechanically fused organisms of its home world, Soulacybin balances deep, squishy realms of organic dub with digital, hyper-active percussion and slimy, stretchy basslines.

Dreadsquad - Poland's staple Reggae Dancehall export


The Dreadsquad project has put Poland on the map for creating dancefloor friendly riddim and bassline madness. From the Superfly Studio in Lodz comes tune after tune combining Jamaican sounds of of Reggae, Dub, Dancehall, Ska and Rocksteady with the modern sounds of Breakbeat, Jungle, Dubstep and Garage.


Dreadsquad was launched during 2001 and what followed was a flurry of mashups, remixes and Polish Sound Clash victories which gave confidence to turn a passion into a way of life for the man at the controls, Marek Bogdanski. Hundreds of gigs in Poland turned into European tours and now Dreadsquad has toured as far as the USA, Canada, Brazil & India.


Always in demand, Dreadsquad has worked with plenty of top Jamaican and European artists including Ward 21, Tenor Fly, Top Cat, General Levy, U Brown, Milion Stylez, Lady Chann, Tipa Irie, Jah Mason, Perfect Giddimani, Dr Ring Ding…the list goes on.


So far Dreadsquad has released 4 mixtapes, 4 full-length producer albums and a host of vinyl and digital singles which made it into the top of the best DJ shops in Europe and into the playlists of the premier DJs of the world.

The Dreadsquad sound is a worldwide sound taking influence and inspiration from all walks of life. It is glued together by Jamaican Soundsystem culture and modern Bass music culture and is a force to be reckoned with.",278113,44,,,,,,3,"bookings@superfly.pl,adam@boomartistsagency.com"

Spieltape,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/spieltape,booking@highwayrecords.ru,"Renowned as one of his country’s most respected purveyors of quality-fuelled house and techno, Alexander Malyutin aka Spieltape, is a man on the rise. A native of Arkhangelsk, Russia, he started his career back in 2005, with his early tracks perking the ears of none other than owners of Global Underground, who immediately snapped him up for their scene-shaping label.

The intervening years have proved just as fruitful, as Spieltape has turned in cuts for the likes of Sasse’s Moodmusic, Kruse & Nuernberg’s Save Room, Acumen’s Time Has Changed, Solee’s Parquet Recordings as well as the mighty Get Physical Music. Added to all this is the not-so-small matter of Alexander’s very own label, Highway Records, which he co-runs with compatriot, Mike Spirit. Partly responsible for ushering in a whole new era of Russian electronic music fans, the label’s agenda spans far and wide — a fact that’s indicative of a roster that’s includes the likes of Adriatique, Alex Niggemann, Hector, Gui Boratto and Gorge over the years.

And it’s far from just the aforementioned names that can get down with Spieltape’s grooves. Indeed, many of his tracks have picked up plaudits from some of the scene’s most reputable international names, with Richie Hawtin, John Digweed, Hernan Cattaneo, Marco Carola, M.A.N.D.Y., Hot Since 82, Lee Burridge, DJ T., Eats Everything, Subb-an and Pleasurekraft among those who’ve voiced their approval.

Further proof of the man’s production appeal lies in the fact that both Nick Warren and Luca Bacchetti have included his music on their compilations, with Spieltape’s tracks playing pertinent roles in both Balance 018 and Arkitekt 02 respectively.

In 2015 Spieltape remixed the classic track “Sunset (Bird of Prey)” by none other that Fatboy Slim for a special 15th anniversary edition of his platinum album “Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars”.

In addition to his production credits, Spieltape is also a relentlessly busy touring DJ. A star-turn at Red Bull Music Academy’s ‘Bass Camp’, he’s also plied his trade at the likes of the legendary Kazantip Festival and the Sochi Winter Music Conference. Some of the scene’s most respected clubs have come under his spell too, with Arma 17 and Propaganda in Moscow, Suicide Circus in Berlin, Supermarket in Zurich, and Volar in Hong Kong all getting the Spieltape treatment. With his best days ahead of him, these are heady times indeed for one of Russia’s most talented electronic music artists.

Diwon,Chill/Mainstream,Erez Safar,http://soundcloud.com/diwon,emily@wearebancs.com,"Tune in, Freq Out - Diwon's bands:  @Bonhommusic and @DreamsinStatic.
► @Diwon is a global artist. He’s known to Los Angeles audiences for his mix of Middle Eastern samples and Baltimore club beats. He is renowned worldwide for his remixes of pop acts like Lana Del Rey and The XX. On the inside, Diwon has the heart of a true-school hip-hop head. A prolific producer, Diwon releases a clutch of albums every year under his production name, Diwon as well as his bands, @Bonhom and @DreamsinStatic. Diwon has been highlighted on MTV for his blend of hip hop and dancehall. Most recently MTVu featured his single “The Takeover” starring Andy Milonakis, which TV Guide recently highlighted as “What’s Hot.” 2DOPEBOYZ & Vibe Magazine's allhiphop.com have also presented Diwon for his rap flips of 80′s inspired sonics. The DJ Booth dubbed him a 'buzzmaking beatsmith', URB said “Diwon is something else…in a profound kind of way”, calling his sound titillating and ‘juicy for the ears’, while The Village Voice described his producing as ‘adventurous and banging’. Diwon has been featured in countless publications and TV programs including the New York Times, CBS, and BBC World News. His slamming live sets include a diverse mix of singers and live musicians, creating an unrivaled festival vibe with an explosive blend of world music, hip hop, and electronic sounds. Like Kanye or Godard, his work takes you through the emotional space of the artist.

booking@djmentol.ro | +40 726 957 271

Dj Mentol was born in Brasov, on the 20th of July. He started his activity as a Dj when he was 15 years old. His love for music motivated him since his early teenage to explore this domain, but it was only in 2007 when, invited to a party, he discovered that he can really entertain his friends, by mixing his favorite tracks. That very moment became the moment when his hobby evolved into a real preoccupation. Starting with 2009, he becomes the youngest Dj of a local radio Dj’s team, for 2 years long, bringing in his broadcasting subgenres of house music such as: deep-house and dance music style: nu-disco, very little known in those years, in Romania. Constantly rising and always eager to learn and improve himself, he played in clubs in main, after-hours, private parties, as well as in warm-up for famous Romanian Djs. In 2013, he joins Vibe FM Team, where everybody can receive the positive vibes communicated by Dj Mentol through his innovative style, by listening Deep Therapy broadcasting, every Monday, at 00:00 hours (GMT +2).",9164,51,https://www.facebook.com/djmentol.ro,https://www.facebook.com/djmentol.ro,,,,7,booking@djmentol.ro

Labels: Cosmic Bridge/Civil Music/Exit/Metalheadz

As a producer and DJ, Jim Coles has been a significant and pioneering presence in various dance music circles for the past five years. Following a formative decade in the global hip-hop underground, Coles took the name Om Unit in the late 2000s and began to travel across genres and scenes in search of sonic tropes to cross-breed and re-imagine. Key to his approach is a desire to never settle for the destination and instead focus on what can be learned from the journey.

What drives Coles is a desire to keep challenging himself, and in turn his audience. Over the past five years, this has led him to distill various influences — hip-hop, dubstep, ambient, jungle, footwork — into a fluid take on sound system culture that sidesteps the pitfalls of genres and pastiche and creates new potentials for exploration and inspiration, with many following in his footsteps. It’s how, in the early 2010s, he came to pioneer the stylistic and rhythmic links between jungle and footwork via a series of acclaimed edits that brought him to the attention of the drum & bass scene. This personal approach has earned Coles praise as a refreshing voice in dance music from both peers and the media.

On record, Coles’ explorations into the deeper end of the electronic music spectrum have come via releases for Civil Music, including a critically acclaimed debut album, 2013’s Threads, legendary drum & bass outfit Metalheadz, where he was given access to Goldie’s personal sample archive as the inspiration for 2014’s Inversion album, Planet Mu, for a collaboration with Machinedrum as Dream Continuum, All City Records, remixing Grammy-winning producer Om’Mas Keith, Plastician’s Terrorhythm, and Exit Records, where he first collaborated with Sam Binga (leading to their BUNIT series of white label releases). The same exploratory approach has made him an in-demand remixer and BBC Radio 1, Boiler Room, Resident Advisor, FACT, XLR8R, and Rinse FM have called on him to provide mixes and showcase his sound.

In 2011, Coles set up a label, Cosmic Bridge Records, through which he has exercised an A&R sensibility that has created an exciting independent home for likeminded artists. The label’s releases, pressed onto limited edition vinyl runs, regularly sell out within days of their street date. Through Cosmic Bridge, Coles has championed veterans such as Kromestar and Boxcutter alongside new voices from Europe and America, including Moresounds, Danny Scrilla, and Graphs. The label’s breadth is best seen in the celebrated, and award-nominated,Cosmolog compilation series Coles began overseeing in 2014. Cosmic Bridge represents a dual path of inspiration: that which Coles found in others’ music, and that which others have found in his.

Coles is also a sought after DJ, with over 300 appearances in clubs and festivals in more than 30 countries he has made the equivalent of over a dozen trips round the globe and counting. And in line with his desire to imagine new potentials for dance music has appeared on varied bills from the Montreux Jazz Festival to Bass Coast, Outlook to Mysteryland.

After two decades in London, Coles relocated to Bristol in 2015. From his new studio on the English west coast he continues his search through production work (the Torchlight EP series on Cosmic Bridge) and aesthetic exercises (the Gates mix series). A keen scholar of all music, he draws from the past and present to imagine the future, never content to remain in the same place for too long.",60746,37,,,,,,12,ben@fieldartists.netMiro@surefireagency.comJerry@theoperatives.commark@civilmusic.com

Feeling blessed for doing what I love  ... 
producing and playing House Music!!!

Music producer, DJ and electronic music enthusiast alike, 7even (GR) (AKA Yiannis Moschatos) hails out of Athens Greece. When not performing, he spends his time in the studio creating his own music… aided by over 15 years of dj performances and an upbringing in a very musically-influenced home. Having spent many years playing at local bars and clubs, holding multiple residencies, DJing special events and promoting his own shows, 7even (GR) has had a lot of time to develop his sound. 
In 2015, he managed to be charted 3 times in housecharts.net in April, June and August Deep House Charts. His releases have been charted in Top 100 Beatport Nu Disco and Deep House Chart, 6 times in the last 6 months. The best place was his Moonlight Dreamers EP’s entrance in No 3 of the chart.  He has been signed to more than 20 record labels from all over the world. 
7even has supported with his sets well-known artists of international House Music scene like Stefan Biniak and Flic Flac. He has participated in the same line up with Martin Garrix, Andrew Rayel, Sunnery James, Ryan Marciano, Chuckie, Orjan Nilsen, Marlo, Jordy Dazz, Tujamo, Ace2Ace, Shermanology and Mark Sixma at Guaba Beach Bar Limasol while he has performed sets as supporter dj or b2b with famous local and Greek djs like Valeron in Alea Lounge Bar Paphos, Eddie Kenzak in Paradise Lounge Mykonos, Ionas Feenstra in Joy Bar Mykonos, Mr. Styles in Guaba Beach Bar Limasol and DJ K in Alea Lounge Bar Paphos.
For him, it’s all about mood and a deep, positive groove… playing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of genre, tempo, style, or release date. Favorite genres Deep House, Jackin’ House, Tech House, Nu Disco and House without any adjectives in front!!!

They make people dance; they jump; they were born to entertain! So who exactly are MORELLO TWINS?

MORELLO TWINS are Remco and Ivo Lemmerlijn. Twin brothers; 22 years and born on Dutch soil. It's the magic from these young deejays/producers that is the future sound of EDM. 

With performances from Amsterdam to New York and from Marmaris to Chersonissos MORELLO TWINS are becoming hot EDM property. 

With a lot of original releases and collabs coming up its undeniable that the sky is the limit.

One of their remixes got noticed and was broadcasted at XITE-TV in Belgium, Germany and Holland using live club-footage of one of MORELLO TWINS performances. As a result their social media channels got an instant boost.

In the DJ department MORELLO TWINS are quite busy too. They had giggs at At the Villa Group, Castle of Love, Essential Festival, Fantasyland Festival, Sexed Up, Summer Open Air, Sonic Festival, Zo. Festival (WISH Events) and many more.

MORELLO TWINS are very well on the way of becoming hot EDM property!

Say hello         
info@deep-chills.com

Deep Chills, born in Milan as Gianmaria Sanna, started his affection with music by taking up guitar lessons at the age of 14. He quickly progressed to producing music although he originally started out producing hip hop beats, which later transgressed into EDM. It was when Deep Chills originally heard New Orleans by Naxxos when he knew he had to start producing in a genre later to be known ‘tropical house’.

He broke through in this genre in 2014 by remix tracks into very popular melodic deep house adaptations. Inspired by artists like Naxxos, Matoma & de Hofnar he reached extraordinary numbers on Soundcloud with both his remixes like You Got The Love and originals like Feelin’ Good & Lighthearted.

With remixes on Ultra Music, Universal, Ego and his first proper original releasing on Miami Beats, we can be sure to hear a lot from this Italian producer this year.

In a few short years TAI went from being one of Germanys most acclaimed hip-hop producers to touring the globe and making a name in his own right as one of dance music's most prolific DJ & producers.
 
TAI’s discography includes an impressive and diverse list of collaborators, among them; Diplo, Watermat, Bart B More, The Bloody Beetroots, Steve Aoki, Felix Da Housecat and Scott Storch. 

His unique production skills have seen him release on tastemaker imprints such as Spinnin, Boys Noize, Dim Mak, Mixmash, Ultra, Doorn and Polydor (Universal). He's been personally requested to remix the likes of Deorro, Felix Cartal, Kid Cudi, Sam Smith, Steve Aoki, Peking Duk, Angger Dimas, Bloody Beetroots and the Swanky Tunes among others.
 
On the live event front TAI’s completed several tours throughout Europe, Asia and Australia, making his mark with eclectic live sets, including performances at festivals such as world famous Tomorrowland (Belgium), Big City Beats (Germany), Beat Patrol (Austria), Future Music (Australia) and hundreds of clubs worldwide, among them renowned venues such as Pacha, Privilege, Create, Space And Boothaus.

2015 was an amazing year for Apollo 84, with Traxsource ranking him amongst the top 20 best tech house artists of 2015. His energetic and stomping sound of tech house propelled him to release on such imprints as Mihalis Safras's Material Series, Kerri Chandler's Madtech and many other top brands. With the support of these releases, Apollo 84 achieved many top ten's in the sales charts on both Traxsource and Beatport. Now in 2016 with releases forthcoming on Cuartero's Sanity imprint, and the mighty Spanish brand Elrow Music, Apollo 84 looks set for even greater things in 2016. With an energetic club friendly sound Apollo 84 has drawn the attention of many labels and artists for remix requests, and this year sees him remixing such artists as Jacky, Rich Wakley, Eskuche & Nu Sky and Jey Kurmis to name a few.  2015 saw the establishing of his Twisted Fusion imprint, a label which has grown massively in the past year, holding regular label party's over the UK and Europe, with artists such as Jey Kurmis, Jacky, Demarzo, Raffa FL and more releasing on his imprint, Apollo 84 looks set for a bright 2016.",9187,86,,,,,,7,promos@gmail.comC@musicinnit.comellis@platformagency.co.booking@sexpandaagency.com

""Ich komme vom Dorf...""

Nein er kann keine Noten lesen und ein Instrument spielt er auch nicht, aber er hat sich schon immer mit kreativen Dingen beschäftigt und in Verbindung mit´n ""feiern gehen"", hat makit dann eben einfach im Jahre 2005 mit dem musizieren angefangen.Durch befreundete Clubbetreiber bekam der junge Künstler dann auch gleich die Möglichkeit seine liebe zur elektronischen Musik regelmäßig auf heimischen Parties in seinen Mixes zu präsentieren.

2006 war es dann soweit, das aufeinander mischen von Tracks reichte ihm nicht mehr aus, er fing an sich tiefergehend mit dem produzieren und live performen eigener Tracks auseinanderzusetzen und ab dem Punkt gab es kein halten mehr, von zart bis hart, stilmäßig wurde alles probiert und so ergab es sich dann auch das er 2008 zusammen mit dem Künstler aamcee und zusätzlich mit Tom Daily das live Projekt ""Unable To Move"" ins leben ruf. Die langsamen Beats machten erstmal Pause, es gab jetzt harten Techno um die Ohren. 2 Jahre lang waren die 3 nun als Live Act unterwegs und die Clubs rumpelten. Aber wie das manchmal so ist, Zeiten und Stile ändern sich und so formte sich 2010 aus dem live Act ""Unable To Move"" ein Künsterkollektiv und makit widmite sich nun wieder den langsamen Tönen, sein Sound wurde melodischer und vertäumter, es folgten die ersten Veröffentlichungen seiner eigenen Tracks, der Rest ist Geschichte und Zukunft, wer weiß was Morgen kommt und deshalb ist mit diesem Text jetzt schluss, denn elektronische Musik muss man hören, fühlen, tanzen oder klatschen und nicht lesen!!!

_________________________________________________
Martin Holter and David Mogyoro have put their talents together to form the new collective ""Holter & Mogyoro"". Since 2013 the symphatic duo from Vienna produces high-quality House Music with a deep, warm and atmospheric touch. They both perform as a brilliant DJ live Act – combining DJing and live elements, like analog Synthesizers – and as a powerful DJ Duo. After great interaction on their soundcloud channel with several much acclaimed Bootleg uploads, as well as their debut release on Mark Lower's label Sakura Music, Holter & Mogyoro definitively broke into the music business. 

They just recently had big success with their Déepalma debut ""All Our Mistakes"" and their Remix of Sweed's 'Finally' which both impressively rocketed various charts across the globe for months. Their latest release on Déepalma is called 'Step Further', a stellar club tune with driving beats and a super catchy female preacher vocal on top. After only two days it entered the Traxsource Top 100 charts. One week later ‘Step Further’ reached position #2 in the Traxsource “Nu Disco” charts and position #32 in the “All Genre” charts. 

Meanwhile Holter & Mogyoro have made a name for themselves and are supported by renowned artists like Milk & Sugar, Vanilla Ace, Sam Divine, Peter Gelderbloom, Sonic Future, Yves Murasca, Matvey Emerson, Sammy W & Alex E, Moe Turk, Tosel & Hale, Lissat & Voltaxx, Peter Brown and many others.

On stage they try to keep their good energy and being focused on one common goal: sharing good vibes with their audience. As Martin and David show at their concerts, these two guys go together perfectly.

Recent releases got published on Milk & Sugar Recordings (GER), Déepalma Records (GER), Spirit Soul Records (SWE), Sakura Music (FRA) and Seamless Recordings (GBR).

After 8 years of producing, since the age of 13, Mark Wells has found steady ground with successful releases on Nurvous, Mother, Alive & Purp & Soul. Low swinging drums and masterfully places vocals consistently create his trademark sound. Infectious rhythm and hard hitting bass lines make sure his music stands out from the crowd. Marks ability to create a stand out song is impeccable, with releases such as “In she came” and “Drivin me” guaranteed to keep a dance floor moving. His DJ sets mirror his production with energetic performances. In 2012 Mark cut his teeth remixing UK bands “Kid British” and “We Humans” proving his versatility and creativity, in turn he now continues to be called upon for remixes, more recently by legendary house institution Strictly Rhythm. Summer 2013 saw Mark signed to none other than Pete Tong's FFRR Recordings. The track released in June 2014, was championed by Pete on Radio 1 and by Ben Pearce in high profile festival sets around Europe. Expect to hear much more of Marks music land in a big way in 2015.

Management: matt@slntmachine.com

From a rapid and ever bubbling upward period of self-schooling and straight up hard work, it’s not surprising that Abby Jane’s distinctive flavor of House music has led to her name gathering steam through out the global dance music world as one of the more focused and exciting artists of the movement. Since late 2013 Abby has exposed her custom techy, 808 sound through tracks released on seminal labels such as Dirtybird and This Aint Bristol blasting her way onto the underground scene.

With her debut release, Feel It, on the original This Ain't Bristol Selections compilation, brought about her place on the highly anticipated Volume 2 released in early 2015. Spring 2015 saw her and Billy Kenny’s 'I OPERATE' EP was released on Dirtybird to critical acclaim. Abby once again returned to her roots on the latest compilation by This Aint Bristol with her track Talk 2 Me alongside Billy Kenny. The Hannover resident is showing no signs of slowing, continuing her strong bond with This Ain't Bristol, great press from tastemaker media and radio outlets like Earmilk and Kiss FM. Handling the music the right way and bringing the best product every time has earned the attention and praise from peers like My Nu Leng to Claude Vonstroke to DJ EZ just to name but a handful of willing supporters.

Over a relatively short time Abby has become a one to watch. Regularly feeding the inquisitions of a healthy and organic fan base, developing her production in the studio and starting every new move with an A1 attitude. Prepare to hear Abby Jane everywhere!

_______________________________

Chris Gresswell 26 year old DJ/Producer from West Yorkshire has come a long way since he started mixing Records at a mate's house in Bradford 8 years ago. Started DJing on an uneven CDJ-Turntable combination, and self-taught production. He has since started to make bouncy, bassy, garage-flavoured house that defines his sound today.

Few producers are as downright eclectic as the Yorkshire-based Chris. A trained musical engineer, Gresswell specialises in myriad styles of electronic music, and has got his hands dirty with both bass and house strands over the years. While he's remained something of an unknown quantity up until recently.

His diverse influences - from speed garage and House, through to hip hop and jungle and grime- show through on his tracks. But though he works in all styles showing in his latest remixes for Rektchordz &amp; Ben Remember,his tracks share that distinct Chris Gresswell sound ! Big badboy basslines, skippy garage drums .

Chris also has a recent string of self releases all with bigger hype than the last, Gresswell's firmly established himself as one of the top producers in the scene and definitely one to watch.

Some say he was born in Detroit, some say it was in Brighton. Others say he was raised by wild giant panda’s in the centre of Amsterdam. Which is hard to imagine since the last official panda-count in Amsterdam is zero.
Asino himself claims that he was born on a planet whose name is impossible to pronounce. He states he was sent here long ago by a guild of Annunaki that secretly run his homeworld to make the sickest beats known to man and all other habitants of the five main galaxies. This seems likely. But then again, Asino also says he is the  son of a pornstar.
 
We don't know much about the origins of this diamond in the rough. However, we do know some Native Americans have found images in ancient scriptures bearing a very close resemblance to Asino. And that some history experts claim to have found evidence that he was the right hand of Gaius Octavius during the Roman period.
 
Amongst friends, clubbers and colleagues Asino is known for his famous sayings, such as: ‘Hey there! You crazy house lovin’ panda bear”  and “No, thank you”. He is also known for his techy and groovy beats that work infectiously on both humans and giant panda bears.
Although not many people know the current whereabouts of Asino, he is frequently spotted in the Dutch nightlife. This might have something to do with the aforementioned assignment Asino claims to have been sent here to do. If this is the case, he is well on his way to fulfill this job.
 
So, there you have it. All the information that can be found about Asino. To top it all off, some facts:
- Asino’s logo is the head and face of a rather cool looking panda bear.
- Asino means ‘donkey’ in Italian.
- Asino plays awesome House Music wherever he goes.
- Asino looks nothing like a panda or donkey.
- Asino was voted ‘most eligable bachelor’ by the Association of Single Housewives four years in a row.

Before he even landed all the ladies would have knotted together a giant net made entirely from their own supply of undergarments, whilst their husbands would be leaping around at the edges with empty tubes of toilet roll in one hand, gerbils in the other, and pockets filled with weapons grade amyl nitrate.

SINES (official),Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/sines-1,sinesofthefuture@yahoo.com,"Trouble & Bass(RIP) | Freshmore

Sines stays repping the dirty South and is consistently working to produce bass-driven club music with Southern flavor; Leroy Bella is the man behind the moniker. Born and raised in Southern Texas, he moved to Houston when he was five years old. He has been DJing for 10 years and producing since 2007. Sines’s forte is providing his listeners with Southern bass and a slowed and throwed vibe with deliciously hypnotic chopped and screwed vocals. His drive and focus for his music and his hood is fueled by pure passion.
He finds inspiration from artists like oOoOO, Clams Casino, and DJ Screw (RIP).
In addition to his own personal work he also is motivated to help develop the talent of others. Sines has established two successful recording labels: Formant Recordings and Freshmore. With his most recent release of the Freshmore label in June 2011, he’s working to rep the South and Houston with productions from up and coming rappers. He has played alongside many great dj's such as Digital Mystikz, Joker,Pearson Sound,Martyn, Bok Bok and Kingdom and many more.

Hypha /ˈhīfə/ : a thread that branches from germinated spores into a complicated, radically expanding network of fine tubes which form the structural parts of the body of a fungus, collectively known as the mycelium.
Aptly named Producer / instrumentalist Hypha has branched off from the norm to develop one of the most unique sounds fueling the west coast bass revolution. Hypha has been carefully crafting his skills and contributing to the evolution of modern sound with his specialized blend of synthesized, rhythmic bass poetry since 2008. With his exceptional attention to detail and his ability to make each note count, he's heralding a new artistic avant-garde.
His arsenal of unofficially released compositions displays the full spectrum, and the consistent depth of his material inviting universal appreciation. He uncompromisingly delivers danceability, while offering a wealth of dimension to cerebrally swim in. Each track offers an exemplification of his greatest asset - his limitless range. A refusal to conform or succumb to boundaries allows him to build from his inspirations and offer a unique fusing of the past with the future elevating his audio art to the highest levels.
Representing Humboldt County, California, Hypha has toured the Pacific Northwest and opened up for artists such as NastyNasty, Machinedrum, Freddy Todd, Babylon System, Cyberoptics, NiT GriT, Dub Gabriel, Siren, Stephan Jacobs, Michael Menert, Joker, and many others.

Hailing from St. Petersburg, Russia, Dimitry Kuzmin aka Nuage is no newcomer to the producing world. Kuzmin began producing under the musical alias of Nuage six years ago with his early releases deeply rooted in drum and bass. His first solo release ‘Missing You’ was included in the Medschool ‘New Blood Compilation’.

His more recent productions have shifted in sound to encompass a wider range of influences and styles, in his own words “to express a broader spectrum of emotions”. Nuage’s first full length release, the incredibly vibrant and deep ‘Music Of Branches’ paid homage to the stylings of Garage, Deep House and 170BPM Eletronica, dropping on Dublin-based Absys Records. With a second LP ‘Print Of You’ released on American Translation Records, Nuage saw further records released on labels such as French imprint Roche Musique, Food Music and Blu Mar Ten.

Nuage continues to create emotionally charged, elevating music, channeling his love of various contrasting genres into his compositions, the end result of which is always a mutiformity of sonic brilliance.

Televisor (Official),Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/televisormusic,Robert.Davies@perfecthavoc.com,"Management:
Robert.Davies@perfecthavoc.com

Televisor were formed in early 2012 as a duo, consisting of Tim Butler from Wales, UK and Tom Parry from Amsterdam, Holland to form a nu-disco and funky disco group! 

For over two years Televisor have been releasing records on multiple labels and have a solid catalogue of original releases.  Televisor have achieved over 15 releases with Canada’s biggest dance label “Monstercat” who have over 2.19 million subscribers on YouTube. Over the years the boys have built a strong connection with their fans through Monstercat, allowing them to grow a strong and loyal fan base for their music! 

Tim & Tom are both instrumentalists, producers, writers and DJs and although they love making music for their own fans they also have a future passion and ambition to write and produce for other artists. Televisor have also remixed for the likes of Icona Pop, Patrick Baker, Tobtok & Golden Coast, all of which have entered high positions in the Hype Machine chart and support from blogs such as Stoney Roads, Suicide Sheep, The Music Ninja, Dancing Astronaut, Indie Shuffle and more. 

Their influences stem from all kinds of music, including 70’s disco acts such as ‘Chic’ and ‘Odessey' right through to Disco House and French House acts such as ‘Alan Braxe’. Although separated geographically, the duo have been steadily releasing music for over two years and have no intentions of stopping anytime soon: 

“To us, music is the embodiment of emotion through sound. As musicians, we see sound as a way to capture and express feelings and moods that help captivate and ignite both ourselves and our listeners. Sharing these feelings with a crowd of people who are singing your lyrics is a wonderful experience, and one we will continue to enjoy.”

In 2013, Televisor signed to Perfect Havoc for management alongside fellow nu-disco artists Oliver Nelson, Tobtok and Skogsra. 

In 2014 Televisor had the pleasure of playing to 3,000 people at Gala UTT in Troyes, France playing alongside Mike Candys, Adrien Toma and Cee:Roo. 

Televisor are also featuring on the forthcoming Perfect Havoc Nu Disco compilation with a collaboration with French Horn Rebellion, due for release later this year.

Muti Music,Chill/Mainstream,Muti Music,http://soundcloud.com/muti,label@mutimusic.com,"Muti Bio:
San Francisco has long been a hotbed for emerging trends and technology and spurned an infinite amount of creative minds, the early 21st century saw the emergence of a musical outlet for these techno-organic-tribal-futurist beings with a core belief in the holistic value of vibrational frequencies in the form of Muti Music (medicinal music)
    'Muti' taken from the 'bantu' word for 'tree' is used throughout Africa as a term for 'Herbal Medicine'  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muti"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" (read more about Muti on Wikipedia)
    Hence Muti Music serves as a committed outlet for the commercial release of cathartic, expressionist and healing frequencies in the form of transformational audio waveforms.
    Varying use of these waveforms allows producers to create rhythmic compositions that not only enable, but encourage humanoid beings to move and gyrate with ecstatic joy and freedom, thereby providing resolve from the apparent stresses of modern day life.

    In the past few years the efforts have been rewarded and 'Muti' has been featured internationally in print media, supported with online and FM radio play, licensed to third parties and proved to be a valuable launch pad for some of the most unique and talented electronic music producers out there and successfully pushed emerging electronic music production trends.

    For free tunes, articles, updates, DJ mixes and events check out our Muti website www.mutimusic.com
    Muti Music is available globally on most major digital retail outlets as well as easily available for purchase through retailers like Amazon, Addictech, Beatport, eMusic, iTunes, JunoDownload, Trackitdown etc

INFO@HOODIEMUSIC.COM


Daniël Pattiata, born on 28 August 1990, also known by his artist name Hoodie, is a Dutch music producer & DJ. At age 10 he discovers music on a children’s program on his fathers computer. Obsessed by a monkey and a drum kit he developed his interest in music at a very young age. Music was not a strange thing in his family. His uncle played in several bands and his cousin was a well-known DJ. 

In 2003 he discovers a new way to make music and made dozens of hip-hop beats with FL Studio. All those beats gave him exercise to give all the instruments the perfect level. When Hoodie decided to start with something new he bought Cubase from the local music store. In 2006 he was still into hip-hop, but he also want to try something new. Searching for a different genre he discovers House music. Daniël was instantaneously in love and he started to make club tracks right away.  

In 2008 he released his first single at Sneakerz Muzik (Spinnin Records). His second release ‘Dirty Maluku Style’on Made2dance Records made a huge difference in his carreer. Supported by DJ’s: Gregor Salto, Dj Rockid, Schlachtofbronx, Teki Latex, Yolanda BE Cool and many more, he had made his first success. In 2010 he released ‘Break Bass’ which was a mix of Electro and Dutch House. It was released on Foktop! (Spinnin Records) and was published on CD as well (Sneakerz Foktop! Summer CD). After all the releases Hoodie had those few years, he got much respect and support from DJ’s and fans from all over the world. 

Daniël’s DJ career started a few months later in 2010. His first gigs were at local bars and parties but after the Foktop! Summer Mix cd he was booked at his first big party with Bizzey, Sandro Silva, DJ Rockid and some other DJ’s. After all those gigs with DJ’s like: The Partysquad, Sandro Silva, Rockid, Yolanda BE Cool, Marc Benjamin etc. 

In 2011 Hoodie made his first bootleg release with Yellow Claw a local group and got into the sounds of Moombahton. He decided to make Moombahton more often since the release of Marvins Room bootleg was a big succes.

In 2012 Hoodie had the chance to bring his mix of Dutch Sounds and Moombahton festivals  and clubs. From Escape (Amsterdam,NL) to local clubs, Hoodie was known as a crazy mooombahton DJ who mixed his own moombahton sounds with dirty dutch house sounds.
 
Hoodie has a promising future full of big releases and collaborations with producers and DJ’s from his dreams. Hoodie is now known as a wild DJ and a gifted producer and we’re all hyped to hear what’s next in the future!",8623,50,http://facebook.com/imHoodie,http://facebook.com/imHoodie,http://twitter.com/imHoodie,http://youtube.com/hoodiemusictv,"http://www.hoodiemusic.com

With 5 consecutive Beatport number 1s, over six million streams in the last 12 months off the back of their lively social media interaction, and collaborations and remixes for @Zomboy, @Datsik, @weareSKisM, @Excision, @Destroid, @Astronautuk, @Getterofficial and more under their belt, few can deny that Barely Alive are one of the most exciting and fastest growing bass music acts to emerge over the last year.

The duo originating from Massachusetts, USA initially made a name for themselves when they released their debut EP through @DiscipleRecordings in early 2014 to global acclaim, hitting the number one spot across 4 different genre charts on Beatport in just 24 hours. This made Barely Alive an over night success, and to this date they have been labelled just under @Skrillex as the second hottest dubstep artists of 2014 on Beatport.

International touring soon followed across the United States, Europe and the rest of the world, with Barely Alive making up one of the core artists of the Disciple Alliance tours, the Datsik Ninja Nation tour along side @Trolley-Snatcha and @KennedyJones, and multiple headline tours in Australia, New Zealand, France and more. They have received regular DJ support from acts such as @Skrillex, @Datsik, @Excision, @Far-Too-Loud and @Zomboy, as well as making regular appearances on huge online music platforms such as @UKF, @EDM, @NESTHQ, This Song Is Sick, and a guest mix for the renowned @BBC Radio 1.

This is just the start for Barely Alive, who within their first year at Disciple found themselves well on their way to becoming a future headline act.

Bio:

The Rio-based duo of Felipe “Fel” Lozinsky and Gustavo “Guk” Rozenthal, has been blowing away audiences and ears since 2007, lighting up clubs and festival with their free-for-all mix of electro, house and heavy low end. The only Brazilians to rank on DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJ poll for two consecutive years, 2011 and 2012, the duo has already conquered legions of fans, including star power names like David Guetta, Flo Rida, Black Eyed Peas, and Madonna, who have all commissioned the duo for potent remix work. The partnership with The Material Girl peaked this year when she personally selected Felguk to accompany her on her full MDNA tour of Brasil, where they performed for sold-out stadium-size audiences.

In 2010 supercharged EDM promoters Insomniac hand picked Felguk’s peaktime hit “2nite” as the theme song for the U.S.’s biggest festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, breaking records with more than 180,000 partiers. Felguk’s appeal doesn’t end there. True fans of electronic music, Felipe and Gustavo are concerned with more than just making their mark in the pop world. Recent collaborations with scene highlights like L.A. dubstep kingpin 12th Planet, Australia’s top house export Dirty South, U.K. bass fiend Example and Israel trance act Infected Mushroom prove that Felguk has its ear to the pulse of the global dance scene. 

For further convincing, you need only look to the duo’s raucous sets at Tomorrowland and Burning Man in 2012, or the full tours of Brazil, Europe and the U.S.A. that will kick off 2013. And Felguk’s future plans don’t end there. With their first official EP set for release in March of 2013, Felipe and Gustavo are ready to bring audiences the world over into the sound they have been cultivating for the past five years.

Over 14 years on the dancefloors, over 100 releases, shows in the best clubs, events and both international and national festivals, 8 national awards for best producer, best DJ and best record label. This is a summary for Javi Reina's long career until now.

No doubt, Javi is one of the greatest House Music names in Spain. His presence in the most important events, season after season, keeps on spreading his success inside and outside the country.

Nowadays, he is resident DJ for one of the most important parties in the world ""SUPERMARTXE"", as well as in two of the best clubs in the world: Fabrik (Madrid) and Privilege (Ibiza).

Flagged by a fresh and characteristic sound, Javi has travelled all around the world visiting cities such as: Paris, Toulouse, Milan, Miami, Brasilia, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena de Indias, Pereira, Oran, Zagreb, Dubrovnik, Moscow, Tanger, Punta Cana... And taking over in massive national events for more than 35K people like in the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca, and other venues with less capacity such as Palacio de Deportes in Madrid, Madrid Arena, Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Estadio Olímpico (Seville), conquering always a multi-cultural audience thanks to his explosive sets with energetic mixes and a great musical selection flagged by his exclusive touches of his own remixes and productions.

An established artist that has converted himself in the creator of several dancefloor hymns and has been awarded many times as Breakthrough producer (Deejaymags) and Breakthrough DJ (DJ Oners). Today, Javi manages his own label Rockstar Music, alongside with Raul Ortiz and Vicente Lara, and with an innovative musical proposal, that in a few years became one of the most powerful national labels, rewarded as the Best Progressive-House Label in 2009, 2010 and 2011 (DJ Oners). Recently, Javi has launched a new project called Zoombeats together with JP Candela and Juanjo Martin, where they will gather the greatest international artists and unite big collaborations, betting for a more select musical genre.

As for his productions, Javi has remixed artists such as Nicki Minaj, Flo-Rida and Chris Willis.

He has released his tracks in labels as important as Universal Music, Subliminal Records, Sneakerz Muzik, Hotfingers, Pacha Recordings, Avenue Recordings, Bedroom Muzik, Blanco & Negro, Clipper's, Rooster, etc.",9490,115,http://www.facebook.com/javireinadj,http://www.facebook.com/javireinadj,http://www.twitter.com/djjavireina,http://www.youtube.com/javireinadjtv,"http://www.javireina.com

Frikstailers (pronounced freak-stylers) rose from the eclectic Buenos Aires cumbia scene, turning the genre on its head with their unique style that saw Fader magazine describe them as ""cumbia circuit-bent through neon dance tunes that interpret the most electric side of South America"".

Bringing their incomparable brand of South American rhythm to London in December 2012, they headlined the taste-making Boiler Room, where they wowed the audience rocking video game interfaces reconstructed as musical instruments.

In October 2013 they surprised MUTEK Mexico with a brand new side project called ""Klik & Frik"" mentioned by XLR8R as one of the best 11 shows of the festival.
To complete an eventful year, they toured Europe twice chosen as the closing act of the night for festivals such as Transmusicales (Rennes) and Worldtronics (Berlin).

The duo of Rafa Caivano and Lisandro Sona released their first LP on ZZK Records entitled ""En Son De Paz"" in February 2013. This 12 track journey through time and space  caught the attention of NPR, XLR8R, MTV Iggy, Zona de Obras and the french Mondomix, and was recently chosen as one of the top 10 albums of Latin indie music of 2013 by the prestigious Spanish newspaper El Pais.
Their previous release ""Bicho de Luz EP"" (ZZK, 2010) also garnered critical acclaim, with Resident Advisor describing them as having taken ""a sound as old and ‘Western’ as hip-hop and fleshed it out brilliantly with regional touches.""

Notching up further accolades with their inclusion on Modeselektor’s recent Modeselektion Vol. 2, and having remixes released by DFA Records and Young Turks/Mad Decent/XL Recordings with their El Guincho remix banger, as well as remixing World Music giants such as Amadou et Mariam and Gotan Project, the Frikstailers are primed for the inter-planetary big time.

----------------------------

Frikstailers viene interactuando desde hace varios años con la ecléctica escena de la cumbia digital de Buenos Aires. En cada track replantean las reglas de este estilo con su toque único que la revista Fader describe como ""canciones cumbieras de circuitos retorcidos para bailes fluorescentes que representan el costado más eléctrico de Sudamérica"".


En Diciembre de 2012 llevaron su inimitable sonido de ritmos sudamericanos a Londres, encabezando la cartelera de una de las fiestas electrónicas más prestigiosas del momento, Boiler Room, donde sorprendieron al público con  ingeniosas utilizaciones de interfaces de videojuegos convertidas en instrumentos musicales.

En Octubre de 2013 sorprendieron en el décimo aniversario de MUTEK Mexico con un proyecto completamente nuevo al que titularon ""Klik & Frik"" y se llevaron halagos de la revista XLR8R que los destacó como una de las mejores actuaciones del festival.

Para completar el año, los Frikstailers hicieron dos giras por Europa en las que tuvieron el honor de cerrar las noches de festivales de gran talla como Transmusicales (Rennes) y Worldtronics (Berlin).


El dúo conformado por Rafa Caivano y Lisandro Sona lanzó en febrero de 2013 su primer LP titulado ""En Son De Paz"" junto a  ZZK Records, un viaje de 12 tracks que ya cuenta con halagos de medios internacionales como ""NPR"", ""XLR8R"", ""MTV Iggy"", ""Zona de Obras"" o la francesa ""Mondomix"", además de haber sido elegido como uno de los 10 discos esenciales del indie latinoamericano del 2013 por el diario español “El Pais”.

Su anterior lanzamiento, Bicho de Luz EP (ZZK, 2010), también aclamado por la crítica musical, fue descrito por Resident Advisor como ""un sonido tan clásico y occidental como el hip-hop, recontextualizado brillantemente con toques regionales"".


Entre sus más notables reconocimientos se encuentran la inclusión en el Modeselektion Vol.2 (el afamado compilado de los Modeselektor), haber sido editados por DFA Records con su remix para ""The Crystal Ark"", además de salir por Young Turks/Mad Decent/XL Recordings con su remix para El Guincho y colaborar con remixes oficiales para gigantes de la escena del World Music como Amadou & Mariam o Gotan Project.


No caben dudas que los Frikstailers se encuentran en perfectas condiciones para afrontar los grandes tiempos interplanetarios que se aproximan.",8901,64,http://www.facebook.com/frikstailers,http://www.facebook.com/frikstailers,http://www.twitter.com/frikstailers,,"http://www.frikstailers.com

Hoverboots is the electronic music project of Nashville, TN producer Jarred Abbott. Southern Hip-Hop, LA Beat music, Dubstep, and Drum & Bass all make their influence apparent in his productions. Pulling inspiration from pioneers like Timbaland, Flying Lotus, and Skrillex together gives Hoverboots a unique sound characterized by syncopated drum beats, uplifting chord progressions, and mangled synthesizers atop massive sub-bass lines. While a relatively new face to the scene, Hoverboots has already received support from acts such as Getter, DJ Craze, Dabow and Diskord. He has also been featured by major blogs like EDM.com, YourEDM, and Trap and Bass. Going forward, Hoverboots is on a path to growing his brand as an artist and looking to cement his name as a mainstay in the ever-changing landscape of bass music.

Mountblaq, has awakened. The music they formulate is made for mass crowds and real fanatics
of the electronic music scene. Seeing videos of their jungle type tracks being played at festivals
and big venues, shows that Mountblaq’s unique-powerful sounds feed the crowd an adrenaline
rush to keep moving. A mixture of big room style, jungle room style, and hardstyle, with a rapid
progressive melody, this unfolds a different experience from every song they produce. With the
support of international grand DJ’s and record labels, Mountblaq is focused on what needs to be
done.
Mountblaq is made up of two brothers raised in Naples, Florida, a town where the old go to
retire and the young cause chaos. Producer Esteban David M. 23, spends his mornings working
and his afternoons producing, making this his daily routine. As for DJ Luis Sebastian M. 21, he
spends his free time mixing big room to Deep House, while putting heads together with his
producer, creating there future. The duo born in Quito, Ecuador, moved to the States at an early
age for a better living. Browsing the internet, they stumbled upon Eric Prydz and The Chemical
Brothers. They heard and saw how Dance music has evolved this decade, giving them a good
ear and their distinct sound. To this day they have dedicated there passion to music which is
there opportunity to embrace the gift they were given. The gift to allow people to lose
themselves into a sound not gentle, but absurdly loud that will wake up the dead.

SueCho,Chill/Mainstream,Sue Cho,http://soundcloud.com/suecho,suechomgmt@gmail.com,"""Get It Tonight"" EP release: September 7, 2012

For requests:
suechomgmt@gmail.com

Sue Cho entered the Electronic Dance Music industry as a singer and songwriter in 2007 when she started working with Jon Pegnato.  Although Sue had no previous professional recording experience, her long-standing love for dance music and 8 years of classical piano training quickly brought out her natural talents in both vocals and songwriting. Their first 2 releases, “Throw Me Down” and “Escape” marked the beginning of her continued success. She is now collaborating with renowned producers such as Robbie Rivera, Porter Robinson, Lazy Rich, Tommy Lee and DJ Bam Bam, while working on her solo projects with the label Illeven Eleven. Her songs have been supported and played by world-renowned DJs such as Tiesto and have reached the top 100 downloads on Beatport countless times.

One of Sue’s most unique assets is the diversity she offers with her vocals and lyrics.  She can be heard singing sultry vocals in one song and then screaming out punchy, punky raps in another. Her lyrics are never predictable, ranging from explicitly sexual content to depicting the core of an emotional conundrum.  

Sue is building a strong female vocalist presence in an industry that is predominantly based around male producers and DJs. She also continues to push the boundaries of clubs and electronic events with her solid live vocal performances.  There is no doubt why she has become one of the most in-demand vocalists in the industry and will keep bringing something new and fresh to the music world.",5434,34,http://www.facebook.com/vocalistsuecho,http://www.facebook.com/vocalistsuecho,http://twitter.com/suecho,http://www.youtube.com/vocalistsuecho,,11,suechomgmt@gmail.com

Progressive talent Halogenix has swiftly scaled the ranks in recent years to find himself on the leading-edge of innovative drum and bass music. His background as a classically trained musician combined with an ear for a vast range of sonic influences has manifested in the distinctive productions that you hear today.

The adept North Londoner broke in 2011 with the clinical vigor of ‘Halcyon Daze’; a Hydro collaboration for underground heavyweights Horizons Recordings on Dream Thief 2 EP. The pair continued to play with their formula with the foreboding minimal tech of 12” ‘Trieste / Disillusioned’, before Halogenix appeared on Noisia’s imprint for breakthrough experimentations, Invisible, with ’Askari’ on Invisible EP 4, alongside future partners Sabre and Stray; all of which gaining airplay across the DJ circuit and a fostering a following straight off the back.

The game opened up for Halogenix when the versatile producer teamed back up with Sabre and Stray in 2012 to formulate the indelible Ivy Lab; composing arguably the most celebrated tune of the year, ‘Oblique’; gaining the traction to secure acclaim from both the scene’s biggest tastemakers and scores of new fans. Calibrated by a shared ethos and a proclivity for the outer stretches of the genre and beyond; the unique trio, signed to Kasra’s Critical Music, have gone on to relish huge success with the releases ‘Missing Persons EP’ and most recently ’20 Questions EP’ with their eclectic brand of silky smooth rollers, ultra-clean tech and crunching glitch-hop experimentations.

Aside his formidable collaborative projects, Halogenix’s solo outings have ascended the echelons of drum and bass; lending his futuristic sound palette to scene proponents Dispatch Recordings with the rolling ‘Take The Lead EP’, Critical Music once again with ‘Systems 001’ and in 2015 with the classy ‘All Blue EP’ on Metalheadz.

Halogenix’s aptitude for DJing is also clearly evident, bringing energy and class to each lineup he appears on. Playing at Fabric’s Critical Sound shows and the bass-fusion 20/20 events as one part of Ivy Lab; he also displays his individual finesse featuring on lineups for Metalheadz, Ingredients Records and as a host of the Critical Sound show on London’s Rinse FM.",10005,55,http://facebook.com/halogenix,http://facebook.com/halogenix,http://twitter.com/Halogenix,,,1,clive@evolutionartists.co.info@halogenix.co.

Paul Rudd Official,Chill/Mainstream,Paul Rudd,http://soundcloud.com/paulrudd,jonathan@showbizztheagency.com,"With 14 hit singles and a debut album already under his belt, 2016 looks set to be another busy year in the career of Producer, DJ and Label Owner, Paul Rudd.

The talented DJ released his aforementioned debut album, ‘The Sound of London’, in 2012 and it listed hits such as ‘X-Me’ (featuring American actress Anne Lyons), ‘Egotastic’, ‘More Amore’ (featuring ViVi), ‘Set Me Free’ (featuring Jaki Graham), ‘Neon Lights’ (with Richard Oliver), ‘Control Me’ and ‘Out of My Mind’.

Since then, the London-born star has gone from strength to strength by releasing a string of Top-5 singles in the Official UK Music Week Club Charts as well as hits in the US Fusion Radio Charts and Top-40 listings in the Club/Dance charts in 17 European countries.

The first of these post-album hits was, ‘Trust In Me’ which featured ‘The Voice of World Dance’, Amanda Wilson. The single went to No. 1 in the US Fusion Radio Charts twice, peaked at No. 6 in the UK Club Charts, No. 9 in the UK Commercial Pop Charts and reached the Top 40 in the European Club/Dance chart in an impressive 17 countries.

Following on from this huge success, Paul remixed for the Freemasons’ ‘Bring It Back’ with a worldwide release on their label Freemaison and then shortly released his next single, ‘Wake the World Tonight’ with Sam Calver on vocals. In February 2014, the gifted artist released ‘Searching’ featuring Chloe Mills which reached No. 4 and No. 8 in the Music Week Club and Commercial Pop Charts respectively. The ‘Searching’ music video soon went viral and the track reached the Beat100 World Chart No.3 slot, topped the Beat100 Dance Chart at No. 1 and peaked at No.6 in the US Fusion Charts.

Later in 2014, Paul re-released 80’s Legend Bruce Hornsby’s ‘The Way It Is 2014’. The track marked a momentous occasion as it was the first time the original had been remixed in almost 12 years since 2Pac’s ‘Changes’. Reaching No.4 in the Music Week Club Charts and No.8 in the Commercial Pop Chart, Paul’s remix had huge support from the likes of Danny Lee, DMC Buzz Chart and Cutmore.

The DJ’s next single ‘Night & Day’ was released in September and had remixes from VIP, Studio7 and David Noakes. The musician is not stopping there, and he has several exciting collaborations due to be released throughout 2015 along with a festive orchestral version of ‘Trust In Me’ (featuring Amanda Wilson) due to be released on iTunes on December 1st.

Now recognised as one of the UK’s most creative remixers and producers, Paul has already remixed a range of popular artists such as: The Black Eyed Peas, David Guetta, Michael Jackson, Alexander O’Neil, Daft Punk and David Grey, to name a few. These remixes and the DJ’s emphasis on fresh melodic tones means his music appeals to fans across a wide range of music genres and this is part of the reason he is always experimenting in the studio with new sounds in order to bring out original tracks.

Having been shortlisted in the final of the ‘One to Watch’ category of MTV’s ‘Brand New for 2012’ competition, Paul has also received support from radio stations Kiss and Capital FM as well as industry legends from around the world such as: The Wideboys, Gareth Emery, Dave Pearce, Seb Fontaine, Andi Durrant, Freemasons and Markus Shultz, to name a few.
The Londoner’s global popularity is further highlighted by the fact he has already performed in locations such as Ibiza, Majorca, the French Alps, Greece, Poland, New York and the Dominican Republic.

Paul will continue this tradition throughout 2015 with an exclusive tour scheduled which will see him appear on selected DJ gigs on the international circuit. So far, the confirmed highlights include a string of performances as a special guest for P&O Cruises as well as events planned across the USA for later in the year.

Powerfully primed for the bass-favoring ranks of electronic music, South Central has proven to be one of the genre’s most unconventional kingpins. A live dance outfit driven to spit in the face of 21st century dance music’s comfort zones, their tremendous sound has mustered incredible landmarks across the globe. Now taking the industry by storm on their own unique terms, these Brighton, UK-based trailblazers really are the unapologetic face of eclectic bass culture that modern dance music has been praying for. 

Emerging with the ability to unite versatile productions and a stubborn track record for live dance redemption, their collaborative efforts have benefitted from a double-edged approach to dance floor dominance. Drawing influences as broad as metal, house and classical music, that fusion of big band energy and coherent dance values remains untouchable. Forget the cookie cutter ranks of dub step and its various offshoots – when South Central strike up, their impact is always felt. 
Armed with three genre-defiant EPs for Dim Mak and successive offerings for Ultra and Big Fish Recordings, their ability to bring new noise to prolific imprints has had the bass-savvy masses gasping for air from day one. Treating their productions as a relentless yet intimate science that opts for innovation over repetition, their middle-finger stance has earned them some serious industry credentials along the way. With a nod of approval as dignified as The Prodigy behind them, this antidote to electronic dance saturation looks to be turning all the right heads.  

Such a versatile sound was always going to wreck havoc on the club floor. Connecting crowds with a focus on upfront energy over meaningless pyrotechnics, South Central remains the center of every one of their adrenaline-fuelled performances. Count tour duties alongside The Prodigy, pendulum, DJ Fresh and Jaguar Skills, plus supporting slots for the likes of Rage Against The Machine and Vitalic and their live capability remains a vital modern dance crossbreed to the industry’s ever-expanding floodgates.

These remorseless antics are showing no signs of slowing on the approach to 2014. Between a remix package for their infamous Hollywood EP, a welcome return to Dim Mak with the Run Hide Survive EP and a peak in attention towards their own Mad Music imprint, the next twelve months look to remain as loud, proud and provocative as we have come to expect from this cutting edge duo set to defile dance music’s safe zones beyond repair.

Promo's & Info: info@navarramusic.com

Two classmates at the Dutch music school “Herman Brood Academie”, who came together through their matching passion & vision of modern dance music. Bauke Top and Youp van der Steeg are pursuing a progressive house sound that touches both the heart and the body itself, by means of melody and groove. 

While Navarra hasn’t been around for a very long time, both Youp and Bauke have separately been making moves in the dance scene for over 4 years. Youp, also known as Frenky Toros, started out as a disc jockey, entertaining people in the region of Amsterdam and later throughout the Netherlands. Shortly after starting as a DJ, he found out that making his own music could lift his sets to a next level. The experience Youp gained as a DJ gave him a strong feeling for what works in a club and what doesn’t. This lead to Youp developing a club-focussed progressive house sound, designed to get people moving on the dance floor. 

Bauke, on the other hand, started out as a musician rather than as a DJ. Playing piano and guitar in several bands during his high school carreer, he learned to write, arrange and perform music before he took on electronic dance music. When he did start producing dance music, his sound became very much driven by melody and atmosphere.

It wasn’t until Bauke and Youp sat down in the studio for the first time, that they realised just how much there visions on music matched. As they started producing, it was as if the puzzle came together; whatever the one lacked, the other complemented. The following months Navarra was born. With their first remix reaching 50.000 plays and their second one ten times more, reaching more than half a million plays, Navarra’s talent and drive are translating into worldwide exposure.",5920,53,https://www.facebook.com/navarramusik,https://www.facebook.com/navarramusik,https://twitter.com/navarramusic,,"https://pitchartists.com

Their marathon DJ sets capture their genuine Iberican character, while their blend of styles between House and Techno lie in perfect harmony, accentuating the unmistakable beat of the percussions.
Throughout the past decade, Chus and Ceballos have been the pioneers and creators of the underground movement known as ‘Iberican Sound’. This resulted in the prologue to an important saga for artists and producers, who have chosen Tribal as their way of life. Their evolution throughout the past years has led them to the pinnacle of the global music scene.
All these years of hard work, absolute dedication, undisputed professionalism and a constant evolution in sounds have led this infallible duo to the summit of success, bringing them to securing residencies at the best clubs around the globe; Pacha New York, Space Miami, Stereo Montreal, Ageha Tokyo, and many others.

Cinthie is a Berlin based DJ and producer, and the creative mind behind the Beste Modus and Unison Wax record labels. A well-known figure in the German capital's house scene, Cinthie's career began as a teenager spinning records at clubs in the 1990s, before going on to sign with Low Spirit Recordings at the turn of the century and finding herself in demand at parties everywhere from Moscow to Mexico. These days Cinthie is a resident at Watergate and [IPSE], where her vinyl-only DJ sets and intuitive ability to weave deep-yet-bassy mixes have seen her become a figurehead amongst the next generation of German house music virtuosos.

Along with Diego Krause, Ed Herbst and stevn.aint.leavn, Cinthie represents the Beste Modus / Beste Freunde collective. Linked by a shared penchant for good house music and a love of Berlin's unending parties, the crew have already pressed four eagerly-sought-after white label 12""s together and been snapped up by Watergate for a residency at the famous club. Along with Krause, Cinthie also runs Unison Wax, a vinyl-only label dedicated to unpretentious, floor-ready house music. Launched in 2014, the imprint's inaugural record gained international press attention and went onto become one of the year's word of mouth successes.

If that wasn't enough, Cinthie also owns and runs the 'Stasi Studios' complex - so called because the building once functioned as a Stasi office. Now home to figures such as Rødhåd, Ben Klock, Roman Lindau, Gebrüder Teichmann and others, the studio has established itself as one of the city's most singular corners of dance-music creativity and is set to expand its space in 2015 to accommodate an increase in demand. With nearly two-decades of expertise, Cinthie's talents as a DJ, producer, label owner and studio boss position her as one of the German capital's most consistent house music figures. What's more, with Beste Modus, Beste Freunde and Unison Wax all positioned to enjoy their biggest year yet, Cinthie's status as one of Berlin's foremost dance-music innovators shows no sign of letting up anytime soon.

- - - Biography - - -

In the short space of 2 years, A Lister has gone from being an unknown artist releasing his first record, to becoming one of the hottest up and coming properties in the house scene today. A willingness to succeed and years of hard work and dedication have become the key ingredients as to why he is becoming synonymous with good quality house music.

Merely 3 months after releasing his first couple of records, Alex gained a Traxsource Deep House #1 Spot with his track ‘Baby’ to add to his tally of Top 10’s. Two Traxsource Top 5’s followed shortly after with his hit’s ‘Addiction’ and remix of ‘James Silk - Inside Of Me’ on King Street Sounds sister label Nite Grooves. 

Alex is perhaps now more currently known for his extensive remix work. Remixes on top labels such as New State Music and Love Not Money Records and for names such as DJ Le Roi, Robert Owens, Karol XVII & MB Valence, Doomwork, Hardsoul and many more were well received by fans and peers alike. 

Recent original works such as his track ‘Whatcha Doin’ earned Alex another Top 5 on Traxsource, whilst his debut EP ‘Stay Up’ on Low Steppa’s Simma Black label earned him support from the likes of Shadow Child and Hannah Wants plus plays on BBC Radio 1Xtra and Rinse FM respectively.

More recently Alex was announced as one of the winners for Max Chapman’s Resonance Records remix competition. He also has opted to venture into label territory of his own, with his new label Sense Records set to debut around Autumn/Winter 2014.

Support from names such as: Jamie Jones, Huxley, Roger Sanchez, Danny Howard, Dosem, Shadow Child, Amine Edge & Dance, Sante, Simon Dunmore, Jonas Rathsman, Ejeca, Dale Howard, Kry Wolf, Sam Divine plus numerous more show why A Lister is a definite name to keep an eye on.",14827,169,http://www.facebook.com/a.lister.music,http://www.facebook.com/a.lister.music,http://www.twitter.com/AlexListerMusic,,,2,eugene@refined-music.commanagement@wrgmanagement.co.alexlister@gmail.com

Carrying well over 18 years of love for techno and performing experience with him, Invite is one of Holland’s few true household names. A modest perfectionist at heart, he translates his passion and drive into outspoken and highly versatile DJ-sets. Whether it’s opening deep and warm,closing rough and edgy, a small crowd or large setting Invite treats every gig with the same amount of diligence and respect. 

When given carte blanche and an extended timeslot, something he much prefers, Invite is able to move a crowd like few others can.
His career has seen him perform at numerous events including Planet Rose, Imprint, and Awakenings, festivals such as Awakefest, Free Your Mind and venues like Tresor, Trouw, About Blank, Paradiso and Doornroosje, on multiple occasions alongside the likes of Surgeon, Dave Clarke, Ben Sims and Jeff Mills. Invite’s reach doesn’t stop at the border however; he has played in Germany, England, Croatia, Scotland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Austria, Estonia, France and Belgium and is looking forward to a lot more traveling.

Early 2011 has also marked the launch of his own podcast series, dubbed Invite’s Choice. Aiming to provide international techno artists a platform to think 100% out of the box and record a set without any musical limitations, it’s quickly become one of the best weekly podcasts out there.",23960,389,https://www.facebook.com/1nviteschoice,https://www.facebook.com/1nviteschoice,,https://www.youtube.com/c/InvitesChoice1,"http://www.radiatebooking.com/invite/

Daniel Zuur – Electronic musician, Producer & Live Composer

Daniel has been a staple in the Amsterdam club scene since 2009. His unique sound and organic mixes have earned him a name in the alternative electronic music scene, as his sets have been attributed to being melancholic, dynamic but above all, deeply melodic.
In 2012, the artist earned the award for “Best Producer” at Vinylized, the biggest Dutch competition for producers in the scene. Daniel has continued producing and played live at national and international clubs and festivals such as: Kater Holzig (Berlin), Katerblau (Berlin) Sisyphos (Berlin), Paradiso (Amsterdam), Perron (Rotterdam), Tivoli (Utrecht), Pleinvrees (Amsterdam), Shoeless (Amsterdam), Thuishaven (Amsterdam), Baum (Bogota, Colombia) and Next Mondays Hangover (Amsterdam).
In the summer of 2013, the producer released the “Tesla EP” with the hit “Never Gonna Break” on Berlin’s renowned label: Katermukke. Further labels on which he has released his work are: Manual Music, Cinematique and on his own label, Zauer Records of which he is owner and founder.
Haunted by the drums and his experience as a drummer in several bands, Daniel has developed an exceptional rhythm and sound that no label will do justice. Terms such as deep techno or house don’t cover enough ground. The producer composes sets that exist in their own singularity; every single one being an individual story that creates its own atmosphere. Every set is textured by a whole variety of original tracks that he adapts with precise care and proper timing live on stage: dialogues, natural sounds and warm beats, all treated into a highly dynamic and unique set. Consequently, no live set will ever be identical.
Daniel has been working together with other musicians such as singer/songwriter Florian Wolff. The interaction between his organic electronic sounds and other musical instruments ¬– with elements of jazz, pop and rock – create a unique and strikingly complete entity. The dialogue between every piece and instrument is exciting in the ear of the beholder. In this sense, Daniel is an extraordinary creative, always striving for progressiveness in his work.

Musical doublets David van der Leeuw and Luigi Vittorio Jansen are two talents from the city of Amsterdam who combined forces and got together in 2008. As a DJ and producer unit they began operating under the name Beesmunt Soundsystem and haven’t looked back since.

What sets them apart is their unique approach when they are in the DJ booth controlling the music and navigating the crowd. Their versatility allowed them to play at a plethora of places, from bars to clubs, fashion shows to festivals. At the mere age of 18, both gentlemen already had their own night at the famous Paradiso venue. As the rep grew bigger, so did the crowds, the parties and the festivals (Lowlands, Welcome to the Future, Amsterdam Dance Event, Dekmantel), even taking them across the border: Paris, London, Bristol, Cannes, Berlin, Antwerp, Istanbul, Lausanne, Bern and Malta are just a selection of places they’ve blessed with their original sounds.

This progress in the realms of dance music also inspired the fellows to advance and develop their own productions and remixes. Always trying to create a balanced but surprising mix within house and techno. Sometimes deep and dubby other times bright and warm.

By building their own studio in the centre of Amsterdam, The Beesmunt Soundsystem has a place to experiment and evolve. Studio neighbor Tom Trago, a well respected DJ and producer himself, was now at hand to provide further guidance in the world of house music the duo fell in love with. They released their first ‘Circulation’ EP in 2012 and their second ‘All Day’ in the summer of 2013, also released by Soweso Music. The EP received great feedback and the title track got featured in Breach’s DJ Kicks.

In april 2014 they released their third EP named “The Baby Maker EP’ on the Bristol based Just Jack label. The EP got ranked 4/5 stars by Resident Advisor and received great feedback and support from various angles. The track ‘Close To Me’ got remixed by Amir Alexander, but it’s ‘How I Wish’ that is picked up best and can be considered an underground hit. Through ‘The Baby Maker’ Beesmunt Soundsystem gained the right attention to play at clubs and festivals like: Corsica Studios(LDN), Chalet(BER), Just Jack(BRS), Soenda and Mysteryland just to name a few. In September 2014 they released their fourth EP ‘Body Shape’ on Pets Recordings. The EP balances between big room and underground, a sublime blend between house and techno. With three releases planned for 2016 and the continuation of their own club night ‘Soundmachine’ (formerly at Amsterdam’s most renowned club, Trouw) it looks like Beesmunt Soundsystem is keeping the momentum going.

Tristan da Cunha,Chill/Mainstream,Tristan  da Cunha,http://soundcloud.com/tristan-da-cunha,tommi@nge-booking.com,"With over 15 years experience in the game, Tristan Da Cunha has established himself firmly on the underground scene and earned his stripes along the way. Hailing from the music capital of the North, Leeds; with its rich musical heritage, it is no surprise he found himself on the path he still follows. Starting a residency (still held to this day) at 21 years old at the legendary house institute Back To Basics, has given Tristan the platform to perform alongside the latest and the greatest D.J's for well over a decade. Crafting his skills warming up and closing the nights, he learned the fundamental traits that make a DJ great! Consistently presenting skillful selections with an infectious energy, Tristan has always aimed for the jugular of any dance floor when he plays. 

After shining for many years as a Basics resident, his reputation and style on the decks has taken him far and wide, performing regular peak time sets at rave meccas such as Fabric, Panorama Bar & Below and has recently seen him become a firm fixture within the highly respected My Love Is Underground crew and parties. This summer also saw him make his debut DC10 appearance, another box ticked on his long list.  Tristan's sound & vibe has defined him as a reliable sonic force, a musical chameleon that can choose the right records, for the right moments, no matter what the scenario. ""Music from the heart, not the chart"", as he likes to put it. Never confined by genre but firmly focused on quality whatever the tempo, keeping the balance equal with old gems and new bombs. Consistently packing the heat and burning up dance floors, it's easy to see why his talents have cemented his reputation as a real D.J's D.J that will never let the party down.   


After 2 decades absorbing music and immersing himself in a wide spectrum of sounds, 10 years of that spent A&Ring for 2020Vision recordings, it seems only natural that Tristan developed his skills as a producer in the studio. Choosing to take the long road and teach himself the ropes, not relying on engineers or ghostwriters to express his vibe, Tristan spent many days and nights learning the art. His dedication and time spent massively burning the candle at both ends seems to be finally paying off! His remixes which are often the highlight on any E.P he features on, continue to gain support from a wide range of D.J's & producers across the spectrum, with his version of ""One Nation"" by Alex Arnout feat Tyree Cooper on One Records being a prime example of this. With a fresh new collaborative label, Dungeon Meat with good friend Brawther, a new label / labour of love Throwing Shapes with partner in time Frenchy, more remixes on the horizon, you can expect to hear some deadly dance floor dynamite dropping soon. There's no doubting that whatever Tristan Da Cunha does next it won't be for the empty gains of fame or fortune, it will be purely for the love, like everything else he has done.

Dance music has a habit of running in cycles, so whilst the newbies are discovering the latest ‘old’ style, the veterans of the industry already have it down to a fine art.
Having been a fundamental part of the UK scene since the 90’s, amassing three UK top 20 singles and over a staggering 4 million record sales worldwide, Jeremy Sylvester has refocused and thrown himself into recording a long awaited debut album.

With a mass of fresh new releases up his ever experienced sleeve, Jeremy is moving forward and embodying his vast knowledge with a great perception of what works, as well as mixing in something innovative and fresh, to keep himself a cut above the rest.

With respected EDM figureheads like Disclosure and Basement Jaxx all showing great support for Jeremy’s talent and vision, as well as noting him as one of their influences, he is now embarking on a tour of the US and Australia to once again spread the seed of his unique style.
After working with artists like Shola Ama, KC & JoJo and Kristine Blonde, Jeremy is now set to extend his collaboration portfolio with DJ Noodles and jazz singer Patsy Fuller both working with him on pioneering new tracks.

Jeremy is a DJ who is capable of covering a vast repertoire of styles, blending them into one sound that has become synonymous and identifiable to him as a DJ. Combining a mix of deep house/garage, classic 90’s style house, deep tech and jacking with a bit of old skool 4x4 garage thrown in for good measure, Jeremy’s diversity and sheer panache is second to none.
His cool DJ sets are known for twisting the dance floor into a sexy melange of movement before letting loose into a filthy beat, Jeremy knows what the crowd want, and he knows how to give it to them.

Not just content as a respected spin doctor behind the decks, Jeremy also embodies everything he brings to his live sets into a whirlwind of production where he flawlessly shows off his DJ sound, whilst combining all of his influences into one big melting pot of dance music splendour.

As the years go by, Jeremy goes on to prove himself time and time again as being an industry mainstay, having built up a stellar reputation as a player who knows exactly what he is talking about. Despite his many years on the scene, the best is yet to come from Jeremy.

Check out my monthly residency Beam Me Up at The Piston in Toronto: 
www.facebook.com/torontodisco

     From a rapturous dawn, dee-jay Mark Penner, alias Cyclist, was knee-deep in disco. After a gold star cajoling turn in the DFA remix competition for The Rapture's ""How Deep Is Your Love"" (alongside fellow Canuk Pat Lok), Cyclist has gone from strength to strength; a successful all-disco residency with A Digital Needle at Toronto's Beam Me Up has seen the eclectic producer share the spotlight with the likes of Al Kent, Kon, Psychemagik & Eddie C, as well as bolster his production repertoire by working with Goldroom, Drop Out Orchestra, Rogue Vogue & notably vocalist Maiko Watson - a collaboration which has resulted in over a hundred thousand plays on Soundcloud. 
     Since embarking on his first international tour - an excursion which included stops in Mexico, Spain & France - Cyclist has brought his indie-dance fusing brand of boogie funk to the global stage, with a full slate of North American & European dates to follow in 2014. His own label, MANI/PEDI Records with RAC's Karl Kling, launched late 2013 to intercontinental kudos, with a deluge of dancefloor-oriented releases to transpire in the year to come. 
     When not occupied by establishing Beam Me Up as Canada's premier disco party, Cyclist is consumed by his passion for analogue synths and digging for records - an obsession which, while steeped in the past, influences a sound that is very much modern - a juxtaposition that makes Cyclist the obsessive, disco-discerning tastemaker he is.",10409,146,https://www.facebook.com/cyclistmusic,https://www.facebook.com/cyclistmusic,http://twitter.com/cyclistmusic,http://www.youtube.com/cyclistmusic,"http://www.cyclistmusic.com

24 year old Melbourne Dj and Producer Michael Zuidland a.k.a ‘Zoolanda’ productions are reportedly blowing party goers feet clean off and inflicting numerous accounts of fist-pumping related injuries. The heavy weight Electro come Rave producer describes his style as being “all over the joint” but many will tell you it’s the sound electro heads are wanting. Raw sawing rave synths, blended with his driving fidget inspired grooves produce a sound that’s rarely known to come out of Melbourne, let alone Australia. 

With countless originals and remixes being in the Beatport Top 100 and with many more records to be brought out it is only the beginning of what is set to be a lustrous career in music production and live performances.

Duane Bartolo,Chill/Mainstream,Duane Bartolo,http://soundcloud.com/duane-bartolo,bookings@thatsound.com,"Standing out in the talented Melbourne music scene is quite a challenge, but something that Duane Bartolo has done without even breaking a sweat. 

Since hitting the scene in 2011 with his first show at Melbourne’s La Di Da club, Bartolo has been collecting fans with a minimal and old school Bounce sound that is infectious and definitely his own. His online mixes are some of the most downloaded for those after a dark, old school vibe, and his Soundcloud is a busy meeting point for those after some unique bootlegs (his 2014 bootleg of Fergie’s ‘London Bridge’ track cracked over 220,000 plays). 

His productions are gaining some serious attention with Duane making regular appearances on the Beatport charts (his ‘Good For You’ track sitting snug at number 10 on the Beatport minimal charts at the time of writing). With more releases coming up on Look Alive Recordings and Flat Belly Recordings, you can expect to see him inhabit those charts for just a little bit longer.
Then again, it might just be his originality and technical skills inside the club that is attracting all the attention as Duane Bartolo is no ordinary DJ. This self-taught purveyor of all things groove-based is known for his 3 decks mixing. No Duane Bartolo set is ever the same and you can rest assured that whenever you’re dancing to one of his sets, you’re dancing to something that is most definitely in the moment and unique to your experience. 


It might just be that Duane Bartolo has unlocked the secret to get any dance floor go mental through a combination of skills and artistry, but he possesses an innate understanding of what people want to hear which makes him extremely special, and this is an ability you just can’t teach. No doubt there is a lot of interest and buzz around what Duane can do - and it is only a matter of time before this buzz is going to grow into a full blown hysteria.

Originally from Shepparton now based in Melbourne, Samm hit the club scene at 22 years of age. Her passion for music (Electro/Melbourne Bounce in particular) and engaging art of DJing influenced her decision to become a DJ.

Samm has toured nationally and has played at some of Australia’s biggest nightclubs, HQ  (Adelaide), Sin Citi (Sydney), Sorry Grandma (Melbourne) & Hotel New York (Tasmania)  just to name a few. Samm has also ventured out to numerous country towns such as Bendigo, Ararat, Sunbury, Leongatha, Traralgon & Ballarat. She has also taken the stage at some of Australia’s most recognised festivals such as Future Music Festival, Dreamland Festival, St.Kilda Foreshore Festival & most recently Australia’s biggest paint party, Ultraglow. 

Looking up to artists such as Tigerlily and Juicy M and known for her interest in bounce Samm is hoping to one day make it to a major festival or event on a more frequent basis, near future focusing on her club residencies around Melbourne.

The Loops Of Fury are obsessed with rave. Since their early childhood years listening to bootleg mixes on tape, they've been banging away on drum machines, amassing an army of synthesisers and cheekily (read: artfully) appropriating samples like there's no tomorrow. With support from nearly the entire spectrum of electronic music (say, 2ManyDJs to Erol Alkan to Knife Party to Tiesto, even Jay-Z!), The Loops Of Fury have been dominating the scene since their underground rave anthem ""I Need"" blew up in 2011. 

The original rave-king Moby likes the Loops' sound so much he's had them remix for him twice. And in 2012 he teamed with them on a collaboration - a brand new dancefloor destroyer called Para (out early 2013).

Remix work has been numerous, having worked their magic for Steve Aoki, Rebecca & Fiona, Sound Of Stereo and Felix Cartal (to name a few). Beatport has been kind, with remixes, tracks and their latest compilation ""Light Em Up"" hitting top 10's and staying in the charts for months on end. Not to mention multiple spins on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix and an appearance on Mixmag's cover CD. 

The Loops' DJ shows have been described as fun, crazy, intense and mind blowing (and not necessarily in that order). Playing packed shows worldwide, performing at festivals such as Bestival and Parklife and touring like sleep-deprived madmen, The Loops have been blowing away parties for quite some time now.

2013 sees the launch of their own imprint, Lotus Recordings. The first release is the aforementioned collaboration with Moby, with friends Mumbai Science, Sound Of Stereo and Baskerville on remix duties. Australia and USA tours are scheduled, plenty more music being written and the potential of an album make 2013 a very exciting time for The Loops Of Fury indeed!",10535,54,http://facebook.com/theloopsoffury,http://facebook.com/theloopsoffury,http://twitter.com/theloopsoffury,,"http://www.theloopsoffury.com

Biography:

Some Blonde is one of the most promising young protégés to rise out of the world- renown music hub of Australia.

Whilst a fresh face on the global scene, SB has spent the last few years earning herself the reputation as one of dance music’s best known sweethearts.

A pulsating combination of energetic performances and mainstage-ready music makes up the amazing paradise that comes with Some Blonde entering the DJ booth, transporting minds and souls to a place that resembles an electronic dreamland.

Witnessing SB in her natural habitat of jam-packed clubs and booming festival stages leaves few questions as to why this down-to-earth beauty has proven herself to be one of the scenes most in-demand assets - a social media following in the hundreds of thousands in addition to regular headline performances both nationally and internationally including Canada, Tokyo, Bali and New Zealand serve as undeniable proof.
Inspired by the sounds of Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki, Nervo, Fatboy Slim & Galantis SB has her targets set firmly on the art of production spending most of her waking hours in the studio. Relentlessly and patiently mastering the craft of digital sound design, SB has an ever growing collection of melodic big room e, cross-genre and club-thumping collaborations.

Some Blonde is a top end performer who leaves nothing in the locker, collecting the hearts of crowds around the world with her name spreading like wildfire. With a recent signing to Lucky Ent and a bundle of successes on the horizon, this is only the start",36162,44,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Some-Blonde-DJ/203757822990249,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Some-Blonde-DJ/203757822990249,https://twitter.com/SomeBlondeDJ,http://www.youtube.com/user/SomeBlondeDJ?feature=plcp,"http://www.someblondedj.com.au

Jason Risk,Chill/Mainstream,Jason Risk,http://soundcloud.com/jasonrisk,info@jasonrisk.com,"Bookings: info@jasonrisk.com

Jason Risk began his career nestled in the heart of Australia - Alice Springs. Since lift-off, Jason's name and music has been gaining snowball-like momentum, with each release storming up the Beatport charts, earning spots on Ministry Of Sound compilations & achieving the praise of globally renowned superstars. Jason Risk's original records and remixes have been copping plays at some of the biggest festivals in the world.

With a name born in the world of online gaming, Jason 'Risk' seems fitting to the signature sound that emerges from his music - self described as 'bouncy, boppy with 'risky' touch. Having since created a solid reputation in the Bounce scene as a heavy-hitter, Jason made the big move to Sydney and is now well on his way to world domination.

Having received support from Bounce royalty such as Timmy Trumpet, Will Sparks, TJR, Laidback Luke, Henry Fong, SCNDL, J-Trick, Uberjak'd and Tommie Sunshine to name just a few, there is no doubt that the Jason Risk sound is one that has been highly esteemed in it's field.

Energetic and always up for a party - Jason is here to fire up any stage he sets foot on.

Ron Poznansky and Daniel Terndrup met in a high school classroom specially designed for kids who have trouble paying attention to boring stuff. They immediately joined forces in the pursuit of adventure, hiking through the Santa Monica Mountains to collect top secret data on benevolent wildlife, mycological oddities and abandoned earth stations. They soon parlayed their overactive minds into making music, drawing inspiration from post punk, house, funk and the vast cosmos. Their remix roll-call includes Holy Ghost!, The Rapture, Poolside, JOTS, Princeton, Superhumanoids, Harvard Bass, and many more. They currently have a single out on ""Throne of Blood"" which received praise from Resident Advisor and XLR8R, and radio play on KCRW, WXPN, and BBC Radio 1. Ron and Dan are always working on tons of cool stuff, so expect new remixes, and a full EP in the near future.",10702,38,http://facebook.com/cosmickids,http://facebook.com/cosmickids,http://twitter.com/cosmic_kids,http://www.youtube.com/user/CosmicKidsTV,"http://cosmickids.us

Thanks for the support and ENJOY.

Sixth Avenue Express (aka David Frederick Lee) is a London-based disco/soul/house producer and DJ. Starting out on classical piano aged 6 years old, David picked up many instruments along the way before arriving at his first original compositions with the aid of a beaten up Evolution MK-149 in the late 90s.


David played in a number of Manchester post-punk bands throughout his teens and early 20s, but always had a fondness for the electronic and experimental end of the spectrum, sighting artists such as Human League, Heaven 17, Giorgio Moroder, Goblin, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Talking Heads and Can among his most influential. His attraction to dance music, which had lain dormant since teenage flirtations with French house and even (whisper it) trance, was rekindled by the emerging sounds of Metro Area and the DFA stable, which opened his eyes to a new world of sonic possibility. After experimenting with a range of styles and different projects, James Murphy & Pat Mahoney’s Fabriclive mix, along with the hugely influential blog Beat Electric, finally convinced David that his future lay in the grooves of disco, boogie and house and he set up Sixth Avenue Express in 2011.


As his debut release arrived on Gazebo at the end of 2012, swiftly followed by his first EP ‘Can’t Stop Feelin’ in early 2013, SAE began to develop some serious momentum - hitting number 3 in the Juno digital charts and receiving high profile support from Greg Wilson and Solomun, who opened his Miami WMC set with ‘Nevada Desert’.


In 2013, friend Matt Trueman was recruited to join David on DJ duties, and later that year saw the well-received release of the ‘I See’ EP on House of Disco. With further releases due on a multitude of labels in the near future, 2014 is set to be an exciting year for SAE and one that will firmly cement his place in the house and disco scene.",6121,26,http://www.facebook.com/SixthAvenueExpress,http://www.facebook.com/SixthAvenueExpress,http://twitter.com/6thAvenueExpres,http://www.youtube.com/user/sirfreddielee,,11,sixthavenueexpress@gmail.com

Orkestrated comprise of Melbourne local heavyweights, Adam Bartas and Dean Paps. With over 15 years of dj’ing experience between them, it is little wonder why they command such a cult following across all venues they grace with their presence. 


Adam owe’s his eclectic love for music to early influences showed to him by his father, who also is no stranger to the music industry. Having being exposed to such a vast array of genres, has subsequently fine tuned Adam’s ear into hearing the best out of tracks and extracting the junk. With the help and drive from fellow partner in crime Dean Paps, Adam spun his first records in 2002. We have all been treated to the edits, bootlegs and most notably; live acapella’s, in which Adam is second to none. Adam hit his straps in 2008 where he successfully polled in the highly acclaimed inthemix awards, finishing #1 in Victoria and Number #7 in Australia. Since then he has played internationally and all across Australia, having supported many of the best including Oliver Huntemann, Phil Kieran, Audiojack and Tocadisco to name a few. Music festivals are also no feat to far for Adam, having played at Kiss My Grass, Future Music Festival and main stage at Summadayze. The clever lyrics behind Orkestrated original, ‘Nightcrawler’ can also be credited to the creative mind of Bartas. Adam’s ability to play to the right tunes at the right time is the reason behind his continued success. 


On the same side of the decks, we have the evergreen Dean Paps. Dean began his music journey at a young age, clocking up many hours of experience by spinning only the best of vinyls. The spearhead behind much of the production that comes along with Orkestrated, has seen many young up and coming producers mimic his style. “Give me a simplistic track with a solid bassline, and I’m set”, is synonymous with the quality that dean puts out in his tracks and sets. Having been part of the electronic music scene for over a decade, Dean has stood the test of time and established himself as one of the most sought after acts in Melbourne.

These two pioneers have helped create and shape the current movement of music in Melbourne that is being pushed and sought after by many dj’s of different experience and tastes from around the globe. You can catch them doing what the do best every week at clubs such as NightCrawler@Levels, Billboards, LaDiDa, Cloud 9, Room, Orange Whip, Fake Tits @ Tramp, Circus and various other venues for special appearances.

Remember that little kid from Indiana Jones? Google ""Short Round"" and you will find a little asian kid hanging out with Harrison Ford and also some images of one of the hottest new talents in the Melbourne underground scene.

Five years ago Vincent Fir aka Short Round found an underground scene that he instantly fell in love with and had been a part of ever since. 
Being inspired by the sounds of Orkestrated and Kalus, Short round spent endless hours perfecting his skills on the decks and when it was time to make the jump from bedroom to the clubs he made an instant impact on the melbourne underground scene.
Playing at only the most respected underground clubs all over Melbourne, in the space of 6 months short round had gone from a side room dj to one of the most in demand DJ's in the minimal scene.
Short rounds mix tapes are absolute fire! Delivering regular mix tapes to his 11k followers on sound cloud  generating over 100,000 plays in a matter of weeks.

Talking influences from the  Melboune minimal scene and an ever growing psy-trance scene - Short rounds sets create a diverse mixture of all his influences and pushing boundries and forgetting constraints of what people expect.

Short round has recently stepped up his love for the scene and started collaborating with some of melbournes heavyweights and will soon be releasing original tracks and remixes for some very large record labels.

After several podcasts and radio interviews at his local radio-station Y102 FM, Jordan had released a 4 track EP in 2011 after several scrapped songs. The album, ‘Sew, Stitch, and Bury the Bitch’, was recorded with the likes of mastering engineer, Tom Volpicelli (Iggy Pop, Jeffree Star, Pat Benatar). The EP was later pulled from iTunes at Jordan's request. Moving to NYC metro area later that year, Jordan has played at countless venues in the Tri-State area and has shared the stage alongside artists such as Juicy J, Obie Trice, Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang Clan and Twisted Insane just to name a few. Royale’s “Pornhub Anthem” is featured on pornhub.com which has garnered over 400,000 views since its release in May 2015. The song, “Nobody Understands” off Royale's album, “Detox”, was also produced by Tony Fadd (Fetty Wap’s “Trap Queen”, which peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Top 100). With an explosive stage presence, a cult following, and a sound Rolling Stone classifies as ""quasi-trappy rap and EDM"", be on the lookout for some MAJOR waves from the ever-evolving Jordan Royale.

---------------------------

t the intersection of house and frisson-thrill trance, you’ll find Stefan Brünig, a producer now infinitely better known under his professional alias… Steve Brian. 

Hailing from the Lower Saxony region, the young German first cut his musical teeth on the renowned Euphonic imprint, quickly and successfully spinning his production profile off into a into a DJ career that seen him in high demand behind the decks throughout his native Germany. Five years down the line and Steve’s DJ’d the world’s A-to-Z - everywhere from Antigua, on the Ministry of Sound’s recent club tour to Russia’s Renaissance Club (and numerous points in between). He’s also expanded his label remit to a host of other highly regarded imprints, most recently signing to Cosmic Gate’s WYM Records. His ‘Time & Time’ debut for the label created instant heat with fans, DJs and the press alike (with MIXMAG scoring it highly and trumpeting: “if you’re after some irrepressibly feel-good music this month, you may well find it here!)”. 

A remixer of consummate skill, scope and imagination, he’s reworked the music of both electronic music and classical composing legends, with everyone from Tiësto to James Horner (Avatar) and Mike Oldfield benefiting from his hyper-imaginative sonic restructures. 

Over a relatively short time, Steve’s amassed a sizeable and impressive discography, which has seen him release his productions through tier-one labels like Armada, Enhanced and Euphonic. With a non-denominational sound and vocal appeal, Steve’s melodies have thus far found him most quickly embraced by trance & progressive fans. MIXMAG said that his ‘Blood & The Wine’ release for Enhanced was “a great vocal defined”, while DJ Mag scored Euphonic’s ‘Neno Itome’ 4/5, describing it as “an express train of thrashing beats, punchy percussion and bouncy bass” and pronouncing it “a whopper”!

Releases like ‘Time & Time’, ‘Fire Sign’, ‘Yaya’, ‘Avocado’ and ‘La Gomera’ have quickly seen him become a go-to guy for many of the electronic music scene’s upper DJ echelon. His music now enjoys consistent deck support from leading trance lights including Armin van Buuren, Above & Beyond & Ferry Corsten, as well as house flamers like Tiësto, W&W & Swanky Tunes. His music has proved every bit as popular on the radio, with ‘Fire Sign’ bagging a Tune of the Week on Armin’s A State Of Trance and ‘La Gomera’ scoring an ASOT Future Favourite and Record Of The Week on Above & Beyond’s radio show. Like many of this others, the tracks enjoyed comparable sales success, both entering the Beatport top 10.

In other studio and music release mediums, Steve is equally versed. In 2010, he released his debut artist album (the 14-track-strong long-player ‘Calera’) through Euphonic and since his earliest productions, he’s been a keen and innovative studio collaborator. This has seen him team up with a range of producers and singers, including ones as diverse as American folk vocalist David Berkeley and Spanish language group Almadrava.

Steve is every bit as adept a remixer as he is a producer. Included among his work are remixes of the massive club hits ‘Live Forever’ by Lange & Emma Hewitt and Alex M.O.R.P.H. ‘From The Universe With Love’. He’s also rebuilt the tracks of many a trance mainstay, Cosmic Gate, Audien, Tritonal, Lange, Andy Moor, Alex MORPH, Kyau & Albert, Ronski Speed among them. Most notably, in 2010 he reinterpreted ‘I See You’ – the James Horner-composed theme from the movie ‘Avatar’ for club floors and the following year reworked ‘Stay Forever’, from shared Tiësto / Showtek project Allure. In Steve also worked with Mike Oldfield on the latter’s revision of his classic ‘Tubular Bells’ album for the release of ‘Tubular Beats’.",7239,68,http://www.facebook.com/stevebrianfans,http://www.facebook.com/stevebrianfans,http://twitter.com/SteveBrianMusic,http://www.youtube.com/stevebrianmusic,,5,info@kissthatsound.de

Look for:
UPDATES ON Facebook & COOL VIDEOS & TUTs on YouTube

for booking inquiries:
booking@iamtemu.com

Award winning singer, dancer, producer, musician and all around entertainer, Temu, was born in New York City to a family of the arts. Watching Temu perform, it can be hard to believe he’s really just one person. He moves effortlessly from mellow soul to raged-filled raps, from talk-box p-funk to sophisticated ballads – covering an astonishingly varied musical landscape in performances that are tightly focused, yet warm and intensely human. Nonetheless, whether listening or watching, be prepared for a journey into the dimension of awe.

Temu joins Lowtemp with an assortment of previously unreleased tracks from his vaults that will certainly make any funk aficionado out there jump for joy. From the relaxed grooves of ‘Who Funkin’ and ‘Boogaloo Blues’, to uptempo rockers like ‘Magic & Sorcery’ and pure funk of his ‘Ode to Bootsy’, he’ll have you dancing in your room in no time. Drawing inspiration from soul, funk, 80’s electro and more, Temu masterfully stires them all into a unique cocktail of 21st Century P-Funk.

Born January 5, 1995, Gino G has been fascinated with music since he was a little boy, particularly Electronic Dance Music (EDM). He played the piano for 8 years until he discovered his passion for DJing. Standing in the shadow DJ booth was not enough for him – he wanted more. He produced remixes, bootleg, and mashups for giving the sets his own style. He made his DJing debut at age 14 in his hometown of Reinach at a party for over 400 party people. He was also regularly featured in several clubs in Basel and the surrounding region. In the summer of 2014 he had his first big breakthrough. His idol and number 1 DJ in the world played his track on a radio show. His fan base grew and grew. In September 2014 Gino G released a track on the internationally-acclaimed label JUMMP RECORDS (JUICY M). At the end of 2014, Gino G signed a contract for EDX’s label – SIRUP MUSIC. SIRUP MUSIC is the largest and most well-known dance label in Switzerland. Over the years, several other big names in the EDM scene supported Gino G’s track. Stars like Sidney Samson, Danny Avila, Lucky Date and Juicy M played his tracks in radio shows or live sets. Furthermore, he made it to the Top 30 Charts for Progressive House and the Top 20 Progressive House releases on beatport. Every month, Gino G releases his own podcast called “How We Party” where he supports other young and maybe unknown talents.",8716,81,http://facebook.com/ginogofficial,http://facebook.com/ginogofficial,http://twitter.com/djginog,http://youtube.com/ginogtv,"http://www.ginog.ch/

Biography:

There is no denying the true musical diversity and acclaim to emerge from
Portuguese and now Swiss residing artist Brologue. The producer then DJ has taken
the European electronic pool into a spin while sharing his musical value globally one
record at a time. Embracing his core sounds from electro, progressive, deep and big
room house to the heavy antics of the trap world, the Brologue profile is stuck like
glue, keeping dance floors alight and the volume turned up while gaining support
from We Rave You, EDMNations, EDMT and more.

Circulating in the electronic sphere with distinctive influences from the industry’s
prominent Skrillex, Afrojack and the inaugural and praised Deorro, the studio came
first for Brologue, tumble weeding into his genuine musical nature behind the decks.
His first Beatport entry with ‘Orenda’ via New York’s Snap Music made marks at #67
on the iTunes overall chart while ‘I Am Ill’ with Jam Aunni soon followed. With an
incredible listenership reeling in over 300,000 plays across YouTube and Soundcloud,
and thousands of downloads, his catalogue including ‘Holy Shhh’, ‘Wasted’, ‘Osiris’,
‘Bunyip’ and highlight remix for ‘One Day Remains’ of ‘High Stakes’ have proven their
worth across the tuning future of electronic music.

Sharing sonic movements across his city and beyond, Brologue handles his music like
fine wine. Bringing an enviable fresh spin to any room, he has graced the pole
position at Rimini of Italy’s Carnaby Club, the Kingsize Festival in Germany and close
to home at Zurich’s Official Streetparade after-party. He has shared elaborate
knowledge of his beats across radio stations and most recently captured fans with
his live mix on Switzerland’s biggest EDM radio broadcaster ElectroRadio.ch. No
stopping the undeniably passion from this artist, dance music enthusiasts are always
kept moving. With bodies shaking and hands in the air from open till close, fans
anticipate the next round of release love from the Brologue studio on Sick Bedroom
Recordings midyear with ‘Thangka’ and a solid list to follow.",5312,20,http://www.facebook.com/Brologue,http://www.facebook.com/Brologue,https://twitter.com/djbrologue,,"http://www.djbrologue.com

Bookings - james@nicheproductions.com.au

R E M i B I O .

New to the game but old to its’ ways, 22-year-old Melbourne lyricist Remi ‘REMi’ Kolawole exudes a unique style, rhythmic flow and an honest delivery. 

His semi tongue-in-cheek braggadocios style, by no means overshadows his lyrical abilities. Remi’s rapping persona is comfortable sitting amongst varying musical backdrops and tempos, and his singing voice is as smooth and catchy as the hooks he sings.

Expertly balancing singing and rapping, Remi’s content is highly self referential, littered with pop-cultural tid bits and tales of a life equally footed in fantasy as it is reality.

On the back of releasing two EP’s in 2011 (‘Childish’ and ‘Five Beats I Love’) his debut 2012 album ‘Regular People Sh#%t’ not only cements his previous forte’s, but also displays a confidence in showing several new ones.

The album (produced in full by local duo J Smith & Dutch) covers a varying subject matter and has equal nods (lyrically) to everyone from Slum Village to Drake as it does Black Thought and early Kanye West.

Remi’s 1st single of the album, APE caused a bit of a commotion down at Triple J. 
As a result, Remi was made an Unearthed feature artist, and his debut LP ‘Regular People Shit’, dubbed the Hip-Hop Show’s feature album. 

Since then he has supported acts such as XXL freshman Danny Brown, Jesse Boykins iii, Melo X, MED, Mono/Poly, Jonwayne, N’fa Jones, Diafrix, Thundamental, Arrested Development and played at the 2012 Sydney Song Summit, Big Sound along side fellow RunForYourLife members.

Not bad for someone whose been rapping for a year and a half!
Remi is being championed as a refreshing, young, evolving, gifted, forward thinking talent to watch, and rightfully so.",5785,133,https://www.facebook.com/RemiKolawoleMusic,https://www.facebook.com/RemiKolawoleMusic,http://twitter.com/remikolawole,http://www.youtube.com/remtron3000,,1,aidan@weareunified.comjames@nicheproductions.com

Joshua Evans first began his journey penning poems as a
freshman in high school. After four years of being the frontman of his
high school band, he made a decision to go solo. Dem Atlas was born.
Evans describes Dem Atlas as having two sides, despite only being one
person.
 
“It’s sort of like there’s two of us,” Evans says. “Dem is the
unenlightened and ignorant side, whereas Atlas is the mythic, holy
figure in control; he is all-powerful, all-knowing and all-seeing.”
 
Dem used his musical experiences to propel himself into different textures
and sounds of music, ranging from Folk to Alt-Rock to Hip Hop. Moved
by art, friendship and spirituality, Dem Atlas conveys through his
music the duality between Man & God, Ignorance & Brilliance,
Enlightenment & Obscurity.
 
Having spent the last year performing in and around Minneapolis
in support of his early 2013 debut EP release, Charle Brwn,
Dem Atlas is ready to deliver his messages to a broader landscape.
 
City Pages' Jack Spencer comments on the EP:
 
""With a style that recalls underground West Coast legends like the
Pharcyde and Freestyle Fellowship, Dem Atlas brings crazy energy and
positive vibes to every track he touches. The quick-paced flow and
melodic voicing smoothly floats along beats as he talks about his
inner thoughts and feels a kinship with Charlie Brown. Charle Brwn
packs a big punch and a lot of emotion into a relatively short work,
and solidifies Dem Atlas as a rapper to whom you should pay close
attention.

---------------------------------

John Roman is a 25-year-old producer/DJ from Toronto, Canada. His distinctive blend of a cutting-edge techno and tribal rhythms has earned him huge crossover support from underground legends like Tiga, Martyn and Untold to mainstream stars like Tiesto, A-Trak, Carl Cox and Mark Knight.

His breakout 2011 single “Sala” was a cross-genre anthem, sounding equally at home in Laidback Luke’s BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix or in a Roska Rinse FM show. In 2012, his debut on Turbo Recordings, “Petrified”, turned into one of the most sought-after club tracks of the year. Appearing in Brodinski’s Fabriclive60 CD, it’s been described as a “footwork siren” by Pitchfork.com, “an absolute techno monster” by Sinden, and “the biggest bomb of all my recent sets” by Tiga.

Also a prolific remixer, Roman’s sound has been enlisted by the likes of deadmau5 & Imogen Heap [Ultra], Tiga & Jori Hulkkonen [Turbo], Proxy [Turbo], Nouveau Yorican [Defected], Crookers [Mad Decent], Harvard Bass [Teenage Riot] and many more.",5957,36,http://www.facebook.com/johnromandj,http://www.facebook.com/johnromandj,http://www.twitter.com/johnromandj,http://www.youtube.com/johnroman,,7,info@johnroman.net

Tokyo Prose,Chill/Mainstream,Sam Reed,http://soundcloud.com/tokyoprose,bookings@samuraimusic.co.,"Sam Reed aka Tokyo Prose has built an enviable foundation to a promising future in music. Initially as a duo, Tokyo Prose were discovered very early in their careers by DJ Presha and signed to Samurai Music as core artists in a long-term development deal.

The Tokyo Prose sound, whilst covering a lot of ground, always seeks to maintain a soulful, deep and polished aesthetic with a firm focus on musicality and groove. Tokyo Prose tunes have found themselves into the crates of artists like Calibre, dBridge, DJ Marky, Presha, Lenzman, SpectraSoul, Logistics, London Elektricity, ASC and many more.

The 2011 release of the highly anticipated ‘Introducing Tokyo Prose’ EP on Samurai Red Seal firmly announced his arrival and was championed by many of the scenes most creative forces. This release went on to occupy #1 and #2 in the Chemical Records overall charts for DNB in 2011 and this EP also spawned a very successful remix 12” featuring Synkro & Consequence.

Tokyo Prose tunes featured heavily in the recent ""Way of the Samurai 2"" compilation. ""Reach"" was released backed with Marcus Intalex's Redan and the album also included a remix of Tokyo Prose & Phil Tangent's ""Parity"" by Klute. However the real success of the LP proved to be the track ""Raised by Wolves"". It was so successful it demanded it's own vinyl release and was quickly pressed in limited edition, hand stamped multi coloured vinyl and included ""Status Anxiety"" on the flip. 

Tokyo Prose is set to release his highly anticipated debut album on Samurai Music in early 2014.
 
Tokyo Prose DJ sets collect together the latest of Sam's productions, alongside the freshest from the soulful side of Drum and Bass, fused with timeless classics that have shaped the way Sam produces his music.
 
Tokyo Prose can be booked solo, alongside DJ Presha, or other Samurai artists as an official Samurai Music night.

Tokyo Prose is available now for UK and Europe Bookings.

Jose De Mara,Chill/Mainstream,Arcadia,http://soundcloud.com/josedemara,info@alwaysmanagement.pro,"Owner of @ArcadiaRecords
Bookings & Management: info@alwaysmanagement.pro

When an artist such as Tiësto focuses on someone, you know it’s not merely a matter of chance. It has been Jose De Mara’s work that has helped him to his well-earned position in the electronic music industry.

Jose De Mara, born in Madrid, started in the production world under the pseudonym “Raver”. He attracted attention with his sound-engineering knowledge on his first work of other artists, like Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, W&W and Cosmic Gate.

After that he began a music career closer to the house scene, without losing his musical roots. He has been receiving special support from big EDM names like Tiësto among many others and is often working with labels like Spinnin’, Kontor, Juicy, or his brand new label Arcadia Records, reaching his turning point as an artist. For all his work and many more he was nominated for “Best Producer / Artist” by the Spanish ‘Vicious’ Dance Music Magazine (2011, 2012).

His songs with DJ Sammy have allowed him to work with some of the biggest names in EDM such as Jean-Baptiste (music producer of The Black Eyed Peas) and Grammy winners Jackie Boyz, even making a co-production of a remix for George Michael’s latest album. Giving him a great experience as a producer. His first three solo singles were released by the renown Dutch label Spinnin’ Records. The first one “Higher Then The Clouds” alongside the famous UK singer Shena, got attention of the international mainstream scene and reached high in the charts in countries all over the world.

In 2012 Jose De Mara started his own record label called “Arcadia Records”, once again getting the support of DJ Tiësto, including many of his work both in the charts and on his radio show. Also his remix of DJ Sammy’s “Look For Love” exceeds 6 million views on YouTube. His 2013 solo single “Nothing Wrong With You” got the support from worldwide top 10 artists like Tiësto and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike among others. One year later his solo single ‘Mambo’, released on the label Juicy Music by House legend Robbie Rivera, got into Beatport’s ‘Electro’ Top 50. And to nicely top this list off; his 2015 radio release in Spain ‘Our Kingdom’, a collaboration with Abel Ramos, went straight to #37 in the main Spanish radio chart ‘Los 40 Principales’.

As a DJ his visits to Pacha New York, Privilege Ibiza or his gigs in countries like Switzerland, Brazil, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Albany and others, have provided a new perspective of clubs for him. Therefore we can expect a leap from this talented DJ/producer who is expanding his name all over the world.

_________________________________________

Hip Hop music has no doubt grown from its explosive beginnings but unfortunately in many ways detrimental to its participants. Never the less like all viable art forms there are those who take hold of what they know to be true and build upon it. Those are the sounds of Courtland Urbano. Organic samples combined with technological rhythms, utilizing anything to create one of a kind beats. His ear will hear what most do not and what is sampled in most cases ends up completely different than its original composition. One of the most important elements of Boom Bap is exactly that, powerful drums over thought provoking melodies. Courtland's beats showcase a style of progression and the foundations of Hip Hop's origins in ways of no comparison.
Courtland Urbano masterfully composes musical combinations; nothing is untouchable to the creative mind of this producer. He is rooted in the origins of Hip Hop music and its culture but creates with the intention of bringing his reflection of this art form. This producer uniquely has the ability to challenge and stretch all forms of vocalism. Any partnership will no doubt yield a fresh contribution to your expression. Always on the grind building his library of beats, he is also willing to produce customized instrumentals specific to multiple projects. The culture of music only continues to grow when individuals are connecting to move it forward. Courtland Urbano is a prodigy who's music will not cease until perfection and who is not satisfied with anything less.

DJTristanJaxx,Chill/Mainstream,Tristan Jaxx,http://soundcloud.com/djtristanjaxx,eldermorennodjs@gmail.com,"DJ Tristan Jaxx's hard-hitting signature brand of visceral house music commands an enthralling blend of deep, pounding sound, larger-than-life vocals and vast & voluminous instrumentals.  These elements combine to form an aural orgasm of consistently elevated energy that is truly unique.  With an obvious finger on the pulse of what is fresh, energetic and exciting, his hunger for compositions and sets that one can completely get lost inside is sweeping the world.  His chart-topping podcasts (which are all recorded from his live sets) have skyrocketed his appeal to new heights.

Named one of Out.com’s “Top 10 DJs You Should Know,” Jaxx spins an immense blend of house/top 40/after hours/tribal/progressive music, while maintaining a signature sound that is easily identifiable as his own.  A night spent in earshot of his orchestra of sound is not one that can easily be removed from memory.  Attempting to anticipate his next move is a feat even the most experienced of party-goers cannot predict as he skillfully mixes and blends his transitions to the point that one is left wondering if he is mixing live, transitioning between songs or premiering a self-produced mash never before heard live (something he strives to do at each and every live appearance).

One of the hardest-working DJ’s in circulation today, his abilities extend beyond his finely-tuned ear for contagious beats that one would be hard-pressed to resist moving to.  He also regularly produces his own versions of songs that inspire him. From radio smashes to rarely played versions of tracks by current artists to classic anthems we can all relate to, Jaxx blurs the lines of what is expected on a dancefloor by never limiting himself to one genre or flair of music.

A generous musician who continually releases his mashes, reworks, edits and live sets, he considers himself “the people’s DJ,” being a consumer of the circuit and club scene himself for most of his life.  From a young age, he would hear a popular club song and in his head he would translate or mashup the sound with a different beat or track.  With constant encouragement from his true believers, he spent years teaching himself the craft, being unconstrained by the bold and sometimes imperfect ideas in his head.  This daring method of learning the necessary skills to share the music inside him with dance floors around the world eventually paid off.

After struggling to be heard in a sea of artists, the stars aligned when Jaxx met with a group of men with the same determination and focus on bringing the journey back to the San Francisco club scene when BeatBox opened in the SOMA district.  After hearing only a few of his early sets, the club owners gave him the support and space to create and promote a monthly circuit party, which he fittingly calls Chaos. This hot-fusion, mammoth-energy monthly party has transformed San Francisco’s dance scene by keeping the focus squarely where it belongs at a dance party: on the music.  Having experienced the trying task of being heard and respected despite experience level, Jaxx’s desire to encourage other up and coming DJ’s and supply them with a platform where they can share their passion for music has resulted in a hugely successful event, month after month.  Jaxx is the resident DJ for the event (although he generally only opens and/or closes the night, keeping the emphasis on the headlining DJ.

While creating an epic journey within one night via the dancefloor symphony he conducts wherever he spins, Jaxx has begun his own journey of sharing his passion with the world.  He is a determined, deeply focused man, perpetually exploring a new party galaxy.  Whether he’s in your realm of the universe and you’re able to get on board or you’re listening from afar, jump at the opportunity to open yourself up to the experience that only a “Jaxx Attack” can bring.

“Music changes with the time, that’s what makes it exciting; you’ll never know what’s next. But the most important thing about music is that it brings people together, for me that’s music.” - Sonny Grootscholten 

Asonn, Sonny Grootscholten (Feb 24th, 1994), started playing drums, keyboard and flute at the age of six. He was practicing every day and soon he got hooked on music. His prom in 2011 was the turning point for Asonn. He was looking at the DJ and realized that he didn’t want to stand in the crowd anymore; he wanted to be the DJ. From that moment on, he’s been producing and practicing daily to make his dream come true.

Asonn’s goal is to give a certain emotion to his tracks, to make sure that when you hear one
of his songs you’ll not only hear the music, but also the story behind the track.He gets his inspiration from his idols like Alesso, Avicii, Nicky Romero and Sebastian Ingrosso but mostly from hip-hop and R&B music. 

His biggest dream is to perform at Ultra Music Festival one day and work with the people who inspire him now. Though what he really wants is making people happy with his music and really mean something to them. 

His tracks have already been supported by world famous DJs such as Afrojack, Martin Garrix, Tiesto, Hardwell, David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, W&W, Blasterjaxx, Nicky Romero, Steve Aoki, Chuckie, Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, DVBBS, Ummet Ozcan, R3hab, Carnage, Laidback Luke, Quintino, Borgeous, Swanky Tunes, Eva Shaw, MAKJ, Thomas Gold, TV Noise, Marcus Schossow, Sidney Samson, Max Vangeli, Daddy's Groove, Sick Individuals, Vinai and Dyro and he’s on to even bigger things. 

Asonn’s biggest achievement comes when last September, Afrojack releases his collaboration with Bobby Burns and Massive Vibes called ‘Sahara’, on his own label 'Wall Recordings'.

On December 16th 2015, Asonn released his remix of 'Satellites' by Bobby Burns and Hannah Robinson on Spinnin' Records. His remix reached more then 100.000 plays in just 1 month.

With his unique sound, talent and drive, Asonn is determined to succeed!",6979,26,http://www.facebook.com/Asonn,http://www.facebook.com/Asonn,http://twitter.com/AsonnMusic,http://www.youtube.com/Asonn,"https://itun.es/nl/gYsc0

KASSIANO BIO...................................
Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and based in New York, DJ and producer Kassiano has been for some time now a pioneer of 'brazilian dance music'.

As one of the first DJ’s to introduce Brazilian Baile Funk music to the international scene by putting out mixes, bootlegs, and original productions through his own label Nossa (since 2006), he innovated new ways of mixing the Rio favela sounds with other kinds of dance music from around the world.

Kassiano’s early remixes, bootlegs, and productions quickly earned him praise and features from magazines such as Bpm, Urb, Fader, and Xlr8r. Eventually Kassiano expanded his production horizons to work with major label artists like Lil Jon, for whom he produced the baile funk infused crossover club hit 'Machuka', for the album Crunk Rock. Other recent work has included official remixes for Pitbull, Christina Aguilera, T-Pain, Bart Bmore, Tommie Sunshine, and Green Velvet, as well as collaborative releases with the likes of Tommie Sunshine and Disco Fries.

Currently he is busy and splitting time between DJ his and working on upcoming solo material, remixing for other artists/DJ’s, as well as working on more music for major label artists.

The producer- and dj-duo TOM & JAME is a team to watch. With their full time dedication and addiction to music, they already have evolved into a steady Dj act, performing around the globe. They have accomplished a big amount of highlights in their relatively young career.

Not only did they receive the amazing early support from the likes of Hardwell, Nicky Romero, David Guetta, Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Martin Garrix, W&W and many others, but have also gained a big interest from major influential labels. In their first year being a duo, this resulted in doing an official remix for the worldwide hit of Martin Garrix and Jay Hardway’s ‘Wizard’ and scoring big releases like ‘Blazin’ on Spinnin’ records and ‘Combat’ on Hardwell’s imprint Revealed Recordings.

This delivery of high quality tracks brought them to perform at major international festivals in the summer of 2014, including their debut show at Tomorrowland (Belgium). With their massively supported remix of Will K & Gazzo – Forth & Back and by hitting the top 10 on beatport with their new single ‘Vandals’, the boys set high bars for the beginning of 2015. 

With a remix of Dannic & Shermanology’s ‘Wait for You’ and a collab with Holl & Rush, ‘Buddha’, the start of 2015 is one to remember. The boys also presented a collab with Dannic. ‘Clap’ was very popular in the festival season and has had its release on Revealed in 2015 to find the way into the beatport top 10! On top of this, their own Revealed single release 'Find You' was the follow up on Revealed Recordings as well and they have released an official remix of David Guetta and Showtek’s ’Sun Goes Down’. With this all in mind, Hardwell & Dannic have named Tom & Jame as the new breakthrough artist in their interview with DJmag! 

The Tom & Jame hype continues its growth among the fans. With performances on several continents including their second performance at Tomorrowland Festival, Tom & Jame is an energetic dj act that will not only entertain the hardcore fanbase.

There’s a lot to expect from this duo, stay tuned in to their socials for more exciting Tom & Jame news..

Nelski,Chill/Mainstream,Nel Ski,http://soundcloud.com/nelski,owyn@superfly-city.com,"Nelski: Making it Live
Quirky &amp; rare individuality are elements that make up this skilled character. It’s these things that have gained this young artist support across the dance music board, with Carl Cox &amp; deadmau5 as examples of the wide spectrum of talent embracing his idiosyncratic sound.

Summer 2010’s ‘Body Pop’ was Nelski’s first track, showcasing his inventive production habits. Habits that crafted a sound heavily supported across all of Radio 1, with Pete Tong confirming support through crowning ‘Body Pop‘ as the opening track of his 2010 Wonderland compilation album. Alongside copious amounts of chart spots, ‘Body Pop’ went on to be featured on further compilation albums, making his first release a massive success. 

From then on, industry eyes intently focused on his next moves.
Since, Nelski has delivered tracks that prove his consistency as a producer, showcasing his diverse sound &amp; individual method. ‘Colours’ &amp; ‘Minimal Life’ with Chris Lake have pulled in support from dance music giants across the board, with further props coming from deadmau5 who used the track in his 2010 summer sets during his residency on the Mixmag terrace for Cream, Ibiza. And Capital FM recently jumped at the chance to exclusively preview Nelski’s recent June release, ‘Dancing’ on their Weekend Players feature.

Although Nelski's DJing skills have seen him featured in events across the world including Belfast, Portugal, Spain &amp; Brazil, playing with characters like deadmau5, Michael Woods &amp; Eric Prydz, his live shows are widely divergent. Live is where his passion lies. It’s here where his artistry shines through, &amp; where Nelski makes his mark as something that little bit different. Using live vocal, percussion &amp; keyboards his tracks are played at that very moment, making each performance refreshingly unique. Nelski has produced an intricate show that requires skill, demands full attention &amp; confidence to execute.

Nelski’s greatest attribute when it comes to production is his flair for improvisation, which is exactly how he learned to play the keys on blues &amp; jazz scales. As a result, he doesn’t read or recite pieces but constructs his works through pure feeling. Taking influences from his samba background, percussion is an obvious crucial element in the music he creates, using the Korg Wavedrum during live shows to project the sounds that neatly compliment Nelski’s most prominent factor, his voice.

This summer Nelski’s live show is being released for the first time as the Whatever Makes You Happy Tour, showcasing at festivals in Scotland, Greece, Israel &amp; Asia. To commemorate the tour, an EP made up of the Whatever Makes You Happy tour tracks will be released in September 2011 on Rising Music.

Nelski has carefully developed an imaginative sound that’s been crafted into a sharp, interesting &amp; engaging live show, sure to catch the attention of a global audience. His musical ethos of “it's about the here &amp; now” is the perfect foundation for an artist that does just that, delivers in real time for the here &amp; now!

“As soon as you hear a track, you can tell if someone has got ‘it’. Nelski has got ‘it’ in abundance. If I was a betting man, I would put my money on Nelski - he is about to blow! Watch this space.” Mark Knight, Toolroom Records

In a breakout year highlighted by a debut single on Axtone Records and 5 highly supported remixes, Devi van der Horst aka NEW_ID is charging full steam ahead into 2015 with his refreshing twist on house music.

Constantly exploring a balance between grooves and melodies, Devi’s unique approach to music has allowed him to stand out from the crowd, while working alongside the likes of Axwell and Tommy Trash. With remixes of Sia, David Guetta, Junior Jack, The Aston Shuffle, and Francesco Rossi under his belt, it’s easy to see why Devi’s ability to provide a contemporary but familiar approach, has garnered him so much influential support. With artists such as Axwell Λ Ingrosso, Pete Tong, Avicii, and Danny Howard being such staunch supporters, it’s only fitting that leading labels; Axtone, Spinnin’, Revealed, and Diffused Music would follow suit in the ‘Trainhouse’ movement. Recently collaborating alongside Tom Staar, Volt & State, and Marcus Schössow, fans can be assured of an excitingly distinct year ahead.",15491,63,https://www.facebook.com/wearenewid/,https://www.facebook.com/wearenewid/,https://twitter.com/weareNEW_ID,http://www.youtube.com/wearenewid,"http://www.wearenewid.com

Management : JAYPRESSUK
One of the most refined and sought after Italian house DJ's and producers, this is  the merit of a long and incomparable musical culture that has seen Luca glide through a very important 28 year career making him one of the most admired and accomplished remixers on the planet according to such icons as MARC CERRONE and LAURA PAUSINI. He has worked with some of the strongest labels on the worldwide scene such as DEFECTED and PURPLE MUSIC and continues to have releases on an ever growing list of international top labels. For Laura Pausini he remixed 'If That's Love' and in particular 'Escucia Atento' that in 2006 won a Grammy Award. With Cerrone the collaboration has been moving forward for many years now such as the 'Best Of Mixes Vol. 3' demonstrates where we see Luca siding up to such main players as Danny Tenaglia, David Morales, Jamie Lewis, Armand Van Helden and Joey Negro. Other remixes in his portfolio include those for BARRY WHITE, GIORGIO MORODER, SANDY RIVERA, JOCELYN BROWN, CE CE ROGERS and AZZETTO Feat. ROBIN S.  For Defected he produced, for the 'GOA 09'' compilation, the instrumental version of LUCA CASSANI 'I JUST...' that will be followed up by the complete single release containing vocal versions and remixes,and remixed,apart from the classic Sandy Rivera “I CAN’T STOP”, the  HAVANA FUNK’s “ALL ABOUT YOU”, whilst on Purple Music he has remixed, amongst others, one of the biggest tunes of 2008, Alfred Azzetto 'COLORS' and is currently enjoying big success with the instrumental version of LUCA CASSANI Pres. AMORHOUSE & Mr. B. Luca has also recently selected the 'My Boyfriend Is Out Of Town' Vol.2 and Vol.3 compilation for Purple Music together with Alfred Azzetto.  His productions have been numerous and have included such big international club hits as 'BRING IT  DOWN' by SIMPSON TUNE Feat. JENNY B. which was also remixed by BORIS DLUGOSH. The latest in the line up is the release Luca Cassani Feat. Janet Grey 'THE REVOLUTION' which is also the first release on Luca's own new label CASTING COUCH Records – a track that has already featured on the Bob Sinclar Radio Show for two weeks in a row! Also on Casting Couch records Luca Cassani and True Beat 'SAFE FROM HARM' , Luca Cassani Feat. Max C 'INTO THE LIGHT', Max who has had precedent collaborations with such names as David Guetta and Axwell and “RRROCK IT!” , also remixed by ABEL RAMOS. His DJ career has seen him resident at the best clubs all over Italy, He has played (and continues to play) in iconic venues such as PINETA in Milano Marittima, SALI &TABACCHI in Reggio Emilia,Qi CLUBBING in Rovato, TENAX in Florence,GUENDALINA in S:Cesarea, ECHOES in Misano Adriatico, THE CLUB in MILAN,NIKKI BEACH in Miami, LE PALAIS in Cannes, CLUB HOME in Amsterdam,IMMIGRANT and STADIUM in Jakarta (Indonesia),LAGARS in Braga,NB in Viseu and Coimbra (Portugal), PLATINIUM in Warsaw, VANILLA  CLUB ONE , WKND and DUO CLUB in Switzerland,  PARADISO in Rimini, PASCIA', BYBLOS, PRINCE and PETER PAN in Riccione, NAFOURA in Castellaneta, LA LAMPARA CLUB in Trani, RIOBO in Gallipoli, DIVINAE FOLLIE Bisceglie, CICLOPE in Palinuro... the list goes on... For the Pineta Club in Milano Marittima he has also selected and mixed the compilations Elite' , Pineta Winter 2010,and PINETA by VISIONNAIRE 2011.  Luca Cassani has no doubts: house music is that which brings him the most emotions but outside of the club world he likes to keep himself updated by listening to any musical genre. To the question 'Why did you decide to play house music?' Luca simply answered that a DJ has to play that which he feels and enjoys the most. Also, he adds, every DJ should concentrate on the technical side of his sets, something that he has always tried to do to his best effort.

The duo first began throwing parties in an Albanian dive bar in Toronto’s east end, but have gone on to grace the stage at a spectrum of the city’s establishments, from first rate to flea trap. They hold down a residency at a rotating disco jam called Beam Me Up which, while held monthly at the Piston, has taken place in a film studio, an artist commune, above a furniture store and inside the Great Hall, and has featured acclaimed international artists like John Morales, Kon, Al Kent, Psychemagik, Eddie C and Tom Noble. Beam Me Up has also recently spawned a radio show as part of the Toronto Radio Project, whose endeavours were picked up by both the Toronto Star and BlogTO. A Digital Needle favour quality selection and sound above all else with an inclination toward playing out their own edits, several of which have been pressed to vinyl on labels in the UK and Italy.

Sam Fergusson known to many as Frenic is a fast emerging UK talent garnering an international reputation for producing music which shows his inspiration from many forms of dance and hip hop whilst hinting at deeper musical influence. Frenic first started making beats for hip hop MC’s after becoming inspired by listening to rap heavyweights Wu-Tang Clan, DJ Premier, and Pete Rock. Having bought a pair of turntables began his quest into understanding scratching and turntableism which then lead him to forming a live act called Lost Project. Popular on the U.K hip hop scene, they played many lives sets to great response, even supporting hip hop royalty like The Pharcyde, The Beatnuts, Task Force and Afrika Bambaataa. 

In the late 90s Frenic was attracted to the growing Drum n Bass scene and before long he and DJ Dis started playing a DnB raves djing for the famous “One Nation” young dj agency. The pair made it all the way to the Movement Vestax DJ comp finishing, as runners up to the now well known JFB. Frenic also moved to Bristol in search of broadening his musical horizons and meet more like minded people. 

Now 16 years on, he has forged a reputation as one of the best party DJs to come out of the U.K, often a regular on the UK festival circuit, and well as his famous annual sets at the F1 Grand Prix and Moto G.P. 

His Sets are defined by a deep a eclectic selection of beats, breaks and bass, uniquely blended and fused utilising his turntableist skills he acquired through years of Djing within the UK Hip Hop scene. 

In the last few years Frenic has focused on his own music production creating a selection of acclaimed E.Ps. Starting with “The Future Will Be Better Tomorrow” Frenic brought soul, funk and hip hop to the table and the hit single “Alright”. “SoulBass” was Frenics next release bringing his dance music influences to the forefront of his production, incorporating big bass sounds and synths, but still with a nucleus of deep musicality. 

The Latest offering, “Lessons From the Past” featuring tracks “New World”, and “Get out of Dodge” Showcase a darker, more cinematic style that has brought widespread interest and international recognition. 

With the DJ diary  filling up and new sounds planned for release, Frenic’s unique musical style and audio soundscape is in line to set the world ablaze far beyond the Bristish shores he hails from.",5832,171,http://www.facebook.com/Frenicmusic,http://www.facebook.com/Frenicmusic,https://twitter.com/#!/DjFrenic,http://www.youtube.com/user/SamFrenic?feature=mhee,"http://www.djfrenic.com

Bio:
Two Australian producers have come together to form Cup & String, a House & Garage outfit that has fast won fans across genres and the globe with their unique sound. 


Both successful in their own right producing Drum and Bass and Nu Disco, Ross Deschamp and Lukasz Ru-Kasu started a passion project that is producing consistently charting tunes and a growing list of industry luminaries keen to feature their work including Grant Nelson, Todd Terry, Jeremy Sylvester, Louie Vega, Artful (Artful Dodger), Dantiez Saunderson, Richard Earnshaw, Dappa (RINSE FM), Grades (KISS FM) and more.


The industry respect they have quickly gained comes from their eclectic interests outside of electronic music and their ability to create deep, dance floor friendly music with their feet still firmly planted in the underground. 


Recently the Duo have had 2 tracks from their Debut EP (All I Need) selected and featured in the Top 200 House Tunes of 2015 on Traxsource and also making it on the Top 100 House Artists list for 2015.


The duo have big plans to continue releasing music through 2016 that will impress fans, DJ’s and producers alike and evolve the Cup & String sound.

Live: craig@primarytalent.com 

Following their Top 10 hit ‘Control’, drum & bass duo Matrix & Futurebound commence a new deal with FFRR with the single ‘Happy Alone’ which impacts on November 20th.

Featuring vocals from the American musician V. Bozeman who recently featured in the hit TV show Empire and has previously collaborated with Timbaland, ‘Happy Alone’ erupts from Bozeman’s soulful, piano-backed introduction into a rush of uplifting drum & bass.

Prior to teaming up in 2007, both members had enjoyed success in their own right. Matrix first broke through with the techno-infused ‘Sleepwalk’ album on Virus Recordings before crashing into the charts at #6 with ‘It’s Love (Trippin’)’ under his house pseudonym GoldTrix. Meanwhile, Futurebound built his reputation on labels such as Moving Shadow, Infrared and Timeless before launching the influential Viper Recordings in 2004.

The duo’s first album together, 2007’s ‘Universal Truth’, offered a skilful fusion of epic melodic soundscapes with heavyweight dance-floor production and original vocals.

Their chart breakthrough came with two Top 30 hits with ‘All I Know’ and ‘Magnetic Eyes’ before ‘Control’ became their biggest hit to date. The follow-up ‘Don’t Look Back’ represented their fourth consecutive track to be playlisted at Radio 1.

The pair have subsequently delivered major remixes including Oliver Heldens x Becky Hill’s ‘Gecko (Overdrive)’ and Tinie Tempah / Jess Glynne’s ‘Not Letting Go’ (both #1 hits) plus Eric Prydz’s ‘Liberate’, Seven Lions’ ‘Strangers’ and Labrinth’s ‘Let It Be’. Creamfields, Global Gathering, Secret Garden Party, Nocturnal Festival, Let It Roll and Brixton Academy have been just some of the highlights of their many live shows.

Matrix & Futurebound also currently host a monthly show on Capital Xtra.",32782,81,http://www.facebook.com/matrixandfuturebound,http://www.facebook.com/matrixandfuturebound,http://twitter.com/matrixandfuture,http://www.youtube.com/ViperChannel,,3,natalie@insanitygroup.comcraig@primarytalent.com

Luka Per aka Smooth was introduced to music at the age of 10, when he began to practice piano. After practicing for 3 years and later on he became more interested in guitar, also in such genres as metal, hardcore etc. When a couple of years passed by he attended his first drum n bass party and he was hooked!

After hearing ‘Under The Moon’ which would appear on Viper Recordings ‘Acts of Mad Men’ album, Smooth was signed to the label and later went onto release his first single ‘7th Sense’ / ‘Squirm’ (feat. KG) on Viper’s sister label, Viper VIP. Smooth is also one half of Telekinesis who recently made their debut on Breed 12 Inch label, as well as one third of City of Dogs, whose track ‘Absolutely Flawless’ was featured on Pendulum’s Radio1 Essential Mix. 

2011 was a breakout year for Smooth, starting off with the massive single 'Feel So Free' on Viper VIP, which was followed by 'Calling' and Smooth's absolutely immense remix of the Matrix & Futurebound classic 'Strength 2 Strength' on Viper's 'Worldwide 001' album. This was followed by two tracks on Viper's 'Summer Slammers 2011' album, with 'Want It' and 'Alienated' (as Telekinesis). 

Smooth has gained a legion of new followers over the course of 2012 with his massive ‘Blinded By The Light EP’ released in January which featured no less than seven essential cuts which showed the amazing range of the young producer. Busy on the remix front as well, Smooth has provided official remixes for smash hits such as Camo & Krooked – ‘Get Dirty’ (feat. TC) and Seven Lions – ‘Below Us’ (feat. Shaz Sparks), as well as the upcoming Matrix & Futurebound single ‘Magnetic Eyes’ (feat. Baby Blue) and Modestep’s new single ‘Another Day’.

Now ready to launch the next chapter of his career, Smooth has set his sights on working towards his debut album on Viper Recordings which will surely catapult him amongst the elite producers in drum and bass. Serving as the first album single, ‘Virgo Cluster’ is the perfect showcase of Smooth’s trademark anthemic dancefloor funk which he is becoming world renown for.",14118,47,http://facebook.com/lukasmooth,http://facebook.com/lukasmooth,http://twitter.com/lukasmooth,http://www.youtube.com/lukasmooth,"http://www.viperrecordings.co.uk

Having ascended the bass music ranks with startling speed, Rollz is quickly garnering the attention of all the right people with his intricate, emotive and powerful productions. The past year Rollz has become an increasingly prominent force in bass music, picking up support from a number of heavy hitters including BBC Radio One tastemakers Zane Lowe and Annie Mac. Now capping off a stellar year this prodigious talent is returning to Pilot Records with his new ‘Firepod’ EP released on 26th November.

EP opener ‘Alive’ featuring Takura showcases just why there is so much excitement surrounding this thoroughly uncategorizable producer and has been championed as a staple in Knife Party’s sets over the summer. Open on a soft wash of melody and the soulful vocals of Takura, the track’s breakdown unravels into a heavy 4/4 stomp and a splayed bassline that reverberates through the track. For those whole like their beats pure, the EP also comes with the instrumental for additional club artillery. Up next, ‘Isotonic’s’ shimmering synths are quickly absorbed into a high energy blend of concrete drums and growling bass, aided by the deft melodic flourishes. ‘Triple A’ opens softly with its sweeping pads and ethereal flickering synths, disappearing into silence only to emerge with a renewed energy as Rollz unleashes tight drum & bass breaks, burrowing bass and flashes of colour. Completing the package, ‘Madrid’ eases in with an introduction full of street life ambience evocative of the hustle and bustle of city sounds and textures. The delicate piano melody and soft female vocal emerge from this ether before the record spontaneously dives into an upbeat dance floor filler backed by rolling bass and bumpy grooves. 

The five-track ‘Firepod’ EP is a collection of finely tuned records that blend an eclectic array of influences, reinvented as something entirely new and unique. With the young producer being tipped for greatness by a number of electronic music’s heavyweights, with over five million hits on YouTube, with music on Pilot Records, Hospital, Ministry of Sound, and even 21st Century Fox, Rollz has earned his respected reputation and is set to continue his ascent right through 2013. Having recently remixed Example’s next track ‘Close Enemies’ and Labrinth & Emeli Sande’s number 1 track ‘Beneath Your Beautiful’, Rollz’s production talent is in high demand.",7904,63,http://www.facebook.com/rollzuk,http://www.facebook.com/rollzuk,http://twitter.com/RollzUK,http://youtube.com/user/rollzuk,,12,james@cakemanagement.com

Bright Light Bright Light is the moniker of Welsh born, London based Rod Thomas who released his debut album 'Make Me Believe In Hope' last year to rave reviews. Hailed by Sunday Times Culture as ""a songwriter of extraordinary dexterity"", by Elton John as the hottest new thing in music, ending up at no.4 in the Guardian Reader's Albums of 2012 poll, and touring with Ellie Goulding, Erasure and Scissor Sisters, it's clear that hid late 80s/early 90s tinged electro-pop has found quite a few fans in the last few months.



Rod, ""the boy Robyn in all but name"" according to the NME, is performer, songwriter, producer and DJ. His debut record was put together with Boom Bip (Neon Neon), Andy Chatterley (Kylie, Nerina Pallot), The Invisible Men (Jessie J, Rita Ora, Iggy Azalea) and won the heart of journalists and fans alike since its release. Single 'Waiting For The Feeling' even brought key 90s production team Trouser Enthusiasts out of retirement for their first remix in 10 years, much to Rod's joy. A remixer himself, his Kelis and Ellie Goulding mixes, and bootlegs peppered blogs throughout 2012. He made DJ mixes for Ministry Of Sound, fashion brands, and magazines, DJd at Glastonbury, Bestival, Standon Calling, numerous Pride events, and runs successful London 90s clubnight 'Another Night' in Dalston's Vogue Fabrics.



Alongside making his own music, he's also part of Slow Knights, a musical collective formed by Del Marquis of Scissor Sisters, whose debut album 'Cosmos' came out 25th March 2013 to very strong reviews and a lot of love from Billboard Magazine. Spending some time in New York to promote the record, he's also played a string of sold-out Bright Light Bright Light shows.",69796,284,http://www.facebook.com/brightlightx2,http://www.facebook.com/brightlightx2,http://www.twitter.com/brightlightx2,http://www.youtube.com/brightlightx2,"http://www.brightlightx2.com

For bookings contact celtislam@googlemail.com
Celt-Islam uses a fusion of music from Dub / Electro Dubstep / Drum & Bass and collaborates it with Islamic/world grooves to create a Dub driven dance crossover. The unique sound of Celt Islam is a fusion of western and middle eastern influences combined with a futurist Islamic dub attitude.  Open the doors of your mind and soul to Electro Sufism!! 
.
Celt Islam has played at various Festivals in UK and Europe alongside Public Enemy's Bomb Squad { Hank Shocklee } , Youth, Eat Static , DJ UMB, The Orb, Hardfloor , Engine Earz, DJ Bobby Friction, DJ Pathaan ,Inder Goldfinger { Ian Brown-Natacha Atlas-Apesta} Mick Reed { 1919 , Ship of fools and Nine Invisibles } , Oova Matique , Dr weevil [ Desert Storm/ DMC] , Peppery aka Bongo Chilli , D Bo General and DanMan { Iration Steppers }.and was chosen by the BBC to perform at the BBC Introducing stage Glastonbury 2010.  [http://www.bbc.co.uk/glastonbury/2010/artists/celtislam/]  

Celt Islam creates music in quite a diverse range of styles and genres. His Sufi inspired Global Grooves create a sometimes Meditative Dub transfixing all who comes across it. Celt Islam is probably best known to date for his work in the genre of his creation – Sufi-Dub – which he singlehandedly developed and continues to define. He does so in collaboration with well known names such as Inder Goldfinger, tabla player for Stone Roses legend, Ian Brown’s band and Natacha Atlas and Dawoud Kringle who has recorded and performed with the likes of Lauryn Hill.

Celt Islam’s Sufi-Dub work has appeared on some best selling compilations including two by UK global music tastemakers Shisha Sound System. Offers are currently on the table from other tastemakers and labels for licensing of his works for compilations.He is also beginning to gain greater exposure in the UK as BBC Radio 1xtra and BBC Asian network's DJ’s like Bobby Friction and Nihal make his music a regular feature on their shows. Dub Reflex by Celt Islam is also featured on the groundbreaking compilation album Generation Bass presents TransNational Dubstep  [http://www.beatport.com/track/dub-reflex-original-mix/1679350 ]  which is available as a CD and Digital download from all major music stores and is also featured on the EA Sports FIFA 2012 Street 4 Game.  [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Street_%282012_video_game%29 ]
Celt Islam is one of the most gifted producers of his kind. We can trace his melodies and samples back in the most progressive part of Islam: Sufism. He is on a mission to unleash the Sufi spirits in the world of 2014; a philosophy which is essentially inclusive, tolerant to difference and other religious systems as well as borderless by default .

Undoubtedly one of NZ's finest DJ / Producers; TREi, AKA Trevor Linnell, has been a leader in the drum and bass scene 'downunder' since 2007. With a slew of producers coming from Australia and New Zealand including Pendulum, ShockOne, State of Mind, and Concord Dawn, TREi has made a name for himself with releases on prestigious labels such as: Viper Recordings, Technique, Commercial Suicide, SOM Music, Shogun Ltd, Samurai Music, and Uprising Recordings.

2013 saw the release of his much anticipated second album, ‘Satellites’ (on State of Mind’s SOM Music imprint), released to much acclaim. Packed with hard hitting beats, progressive rollers, and proven Dancefloor smashers including the singles ‘Change Your Mind’ (with Thomas Oliver), Homecoming (with MC Tali) and ‘Running” (also with Thomas Oliver), as well as collaborations with The Upbeats & State of Mind. Continuing on from where 2009’s highly acclaimed debut ‘Innuendo’ left off, ‘Satellites’ has propelled TREi even further into the musical stratosphere.

Now signed Exclusively with Viper Recordings, TREi will be working on his next string of singles and EP’s for the label in lead up to his next studio album.

TREi’s association with Viper Recordings goes back to 2011 where he made his debut on the label with the single ‘The Light / Mumbo Jumbo’ and a series of tracks featured on various Viper compilations including ‘Habituated’ and ‘Placebo’, as well as his first Beatport #1 with the smash hit ‘Seeds’ in 2014. Following the success of ‘Seeds’, TREi released another huge track with Viper in the form of his remix of Tali’s ‘Forces’ from Viper’s ‘Decade of Viper’ 10 year anniversary album.

Finishing the year in style, TREi capped off an amazing 2014 with the ‘Empires EP’ released on Drumsound & Bassline Smith’s Technique Recordings. Receiving massive support from Friction on BBC Radio 1, the lead title track ‘Empire’ was selected as the prestigious ‘Friction Fire’ track of the week.

BIOG 2016

Over the last few years, DJ Erb N Dub's reputation has grown at a dramatic rate.

It’s not in Erb N Dub's nature to just crossfade robotically between the biggest tracks of the day. Anyone who's caught one of his scratch-laden four-deck sets of dancefloor destruction knows this only too well. Whatever facet of the craft you look at, whether it's crate-digging, mixing, scratching, juggling or straight party-hyping, he's constantly looking to take his skills to ever higher levels. Which is one reason why his UKF podcast smashed download records, and he's regularly to be found behind the decks across Europe and North America as well as his native UK.

Since 2007 he's been releasing a slew of weighty tracks on labels like Playaz, Technique and many more plus a top 5 Beatport release with his smasher ‘Moshpit’. He's been a remixer of choice for labels such as Sony and OWSLA for a string of artists including Foreign Beggars, A Skillz, DJ Fresh, Deekline, Freestylers and Krafty Kuts. His tunes are consistently blowing up raves and airwaves worldwide, with support from Andy C, Friction, Drumsound and Bassline Smith, Jaguar Skills, Crissy Criss, TC, Phace, Hype, The Upbeats, Mefjus and Dirty Phonics to name just a few.

Erb N Dub also takes the time to prove his musical credentials in other ways. He's been honing his craft as a drummer since his schooldays, and now you can catch him as part of the new live act Wicked City, alongside Krafty Kuts and Dynamite MC. Not only that, but 2013 saw him build, from scratch, his 20 20 studio complex in Kent. With such deep immersion in music, no wonder Yamaha chose him for a prestigious endorsement.

Look out for new music forthcoming on Technique Recordings, and for Erb N Dub on the decks hyping a dance near you.",12436,90,http://facebook.com/erbndubmusic,http://facebook.com/erbndubmusic,http://twitter.com/erbndub,http://youtube.com/erbndub,"http://erbndub.com

At only 21 years’ old and with releases on both Hospital Records and Med School Music, Keeno presents his debut EP “Nocturne”. Having been nominated for 3 Awards at the Drum & Bass Arena Awards 2014 and with support from the likes of London Elektricity, S.P.Y, Camo & Krooked, BCee and many more, he’s moving up in the scene fast. The UK-based producer is rapidly becoming synonymous for his ability to add orchestral and cinematic elements to Drum & Bass on a grand scale whilst retaining a strong dancefloor impact.

Following his exclusive signing to Med School in 2014, Keeno released his debut album ""Life Cycle"" in June to critical acclaim. His LP was nominated for 3 awards at the Drum and Bass Arena Awards 2014 including ""Best Album"" and ""Best Newcomer Producer"".

Fast forward to 2015, Keeno released his second EP ""Preludes"". The EP shows Keeno's progression as an artists since ""Life Cycle"" with polished production techniques and a matured sound world. 

Keeno’s remixes are infamous in the scene. Most notably his remix of “Get Out” by Casey Abrams rose to No.1 in the Estonian and Lithuanian charts and is going down a storm on YouTube. And along with long-term collaborater Whiney, another young star, together they have been turning heads with their remix of S.P.Y’s iconic “By Your Side” – the remix had the whole scene begging for a release.

The future looks bright for this orchestral wonder kid.",16804,60,http://www.facebook.com/keenodnb,http://www.facebook.com/keenodnb,http://twitter.com/keenodnb,http://youtube.com/user/keenodnb,"http://www.medschoolmusic.com/artists/keeno

Dr Packer,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/dr-packer,drpackeredits@gmail.com,"Follow Dr Packer On Facebook 
https://www.facebook.com/drpackeredits

Dr Packer is an alias of West Australian DJ/Producer 'Greg Packer' set up for Remixes & Edits of mainly retro music such as 70's , 80's , 90's Soul , Disco , Funk , Hip Hop & Reggae , Greg although known more for 'Liquid Drum & Bass' regularly plays sets of 'Old School Funk , Disco , Hip Hop Etc' purchasing his first record in 1982 at the age of 10 'Grandmaster Flash - The Message' whilst still living in the UK (Northampton England) greg grew up listening to his mothers disco records (had no choice really) as a child in the 70's it wasn't uncommon to hear music such as 'Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now' or 'And The Beat Goes On' played in the house so the disco thing really was his first introduction to music , records became his life and has collected approx 25,000 over the years...

Shortly after whilst still living in the UK greg was exposed to a record label called 'Street Sounds' ran by 'Morgan Khan' he began collecting the 'Electro Series' and 'Street Sounds Series' and a regular follower of 'Mike Allen's - Capitol Radio' show in London , he was a full blown 'B-Boy' and Hip Hop Junkie , he even won a breakdancing competition in 'Lowestoft England' back in 1985 

Moving on to the 90's shortly after emigrating to 'Perth Western Australia' greg purchased his first pair of decks in 1989 making this year his 26th year behind the decks , in 1991 he won the WA DMC's and defended the title in 1992 but by this time greg preferred Club Dj-ing and longer sets rather than a 5 minute scratch battle routine... 

Greg then moved onto 'Jungle & Drum & Bass' music in the early 90s and often regarded as a pioneer of that sound in Australia winning many awards and went semi global touring (UK , Europe , Asia , New Zealand & Australia) several times playing alongside heavyweights such as 'LTJ Bukem & Carl Cox' to name a few... 

In 1998 Greg took up production and set up his own studio running his own label 'Interphase Music' He produced over 100 tracks & remixes under the name 'Greg Packer' and was signed to many other labels in the UK & USA including 'Good Looking Records'

Early 2013 greg began mixing entire sets from CD therefore searching for music online , he started picking up re-edits, a certain artist stood out to him known as the 'Late Nite Tuff Guy' he loved the way the original songs were beefed up and sounded fat on a club system but the original vibe was still there , also these edits were quantised perfectly meaning you were able to beat mix them flawlessly unlike playing the original vinyl... 

In August 2013 Greg Produced his first two edits under the name 'Dr Packer' which was 'Keni Burke - Rising To The Top' and 'Hall & Oates - I Can't Go For That' unsure of what to do with them he sent them to 'Fingerman' he instantly played both of them on his show and suggested to send more his way ,  this was the push he needed to continue what was initially a bit of a fun experiment... 

Labels Such as 'Z Recordings , Disco Dat , Hot Digits , Masterworks  & Midnight Riot' have all shown plenty of love for the doctor so things wont be slowing down anytime soon... every release so far has hit the number one spot on the 'Juno Download sales chart' so thank you for your support and following my soundcloud page , more edits can be found on the Dr Packer bandcamp page...

AIMES is the production moniker and musical alter ego of Alabama born,
Brooklyn resident, Aman Ellis. His music is psychedelic at heart, provoking hints of new-wave, italo, and cosmic disco. Lush synths and washed out vocals juxtapose big kicks and silky bass lines. The self-dubbed “Space Pop” explores vast sonic territories, keeping a close affinity to other-worldly psychedelia and interstellar weirdness.

Afro Monk,Chill/Mainstream,JM,http://soundcloud.com/afromonk,Anders.massiveideas@gmail.com,"At a time when it seems like many producers and DJs are leaning more and more towards aggressive music such as brostep, Afro Monk is doing just the opposite and bringing the romance back to the dance floor with downtempo sounds and chilled-out future beats. Combining fluid melodies, sultry rhythms and hypnotic bass, Afro Monk uses lush yet cutting-edge electronic beats to create a smooth and sensual vibe.

His wildly popular bass music blog Afro Monk is the source where many fans look for new sounds and insightful commentary, which can also be found in his writings for The Untz and Big Up Magazine. 

Afro Monk is ready to bring his lush, chilled-out sounds to crowds large and small across the country. His focus on downtempo lounge music, trip hop, ambient and other mellow electronic music genres make Afro Monk an ideal choice to perform early or late sets at festivals, prefunks, afterparties and all the other occasions that require music to vibe to.

TomFall,Chill/Mainstream,Tomi Fallenius,http://soundcloud.com/tomfall,carlos@one3twoPR.com,"EDM aficionados often posses an insatiable desire for new talent that can deliver a refreshing twist to their ears. For Tom Fall, the challenge seems to come naturally. A native of Lohja, Finland, the 27-year-old producer began his journey into the realm of music at age 10. Like every ambitious child with a musical passion, Fall began to experiment with a variety of instruments, but most commonly found himself learning to play his brother’s guitar by ear. It wasn’t long until those ears became mesmerized by the sounds that one can only find within the elusive world of electronic dance music.

As his love for trance, progressive, and house increased, the 16-year-old set his sights onto the complex, fascinating world of music production. The self-taught talent began his production endeavors with the legendary Modplug Tracker, and continuously challenged himself further, ultimately with Cubase. After a few years performing live DJ shows, and fine tuning his production skills, the budding talent saw his first and only demo, “Cubic,” released as a single on Anjunadeep in 2010. After releasing a handful of tracks, including his own Sirius XM BPM radio hit single, “Untouchable feat. Jwayden,” Tom Fall has become one of EDM’s most highly-requested remixers and producers in just a few short months. Fall has reworked tunes for a multitude of high profile artists, including Armin van Buuren, Cosmic Gate, W&W, and Morgan Page. His latest original single, “iROK,” released over the summer and became a colossal success, peaking at #22 on the Beatport Progressive House Top 100 chart. It flooded airwaves across the globe and top DJ radio shows for months, and received support by several of the industry’s top DJs, including Hardwell, Knife Party, tyDi, and Tritonal. 

The constantly-evolving-producer recently received a coveted spot on Armin van Buuren’s “A State of Trance 550” event at Ministry of Sound in London. His set showcased his ability to seamlessly mesh a variety of EDM subgenres into what became one of the most widely welcomed sets of the night.  After releasing a wide array of remixes in such a short amount of time, the self-proclaimed studio rat will soon begin working on his debut album, slated for release on Armada Music. Fans can expect the album to encapsulate the different sonic elements that make an original Tom Fall record unique, infectious, and memorable.

DIRTCAPS

Only a select number of modern dance artists can convincingly say they are taking the house sound to a next level. With ‘main-room’ written all over them, Dirtcaps are undoubtedly among them. Renowned for their innovative approach and intricate production values, the Dutch producers / DJs have stealthily pushed themselves to the front of the house music pack since coming together in 2007.

Through their own energising DJ sets, Dirtcaps have conquered some of the biggest club brands in the game. They headlined several big festival stages this summerseason and have also rocked house totem poles like Incredible - Brabanthallen, Dance Valley Festival, Chuckie’s Dirty Dutch and Fame=Dutch over Europe. On home turf, they command a legendary residency at Club stalker and Girls Love Dj's!

Production wise, these golden boys seem unstoppable with their long list of club bangers such as ""Where's The Bomb"", ""The Bombdrum"" and loads of massively supported bootlegs.",32681,78,http://www.facebook.com/dirtcaps,http://www.facebook.com/dirtcaps,http://twitter.com/Dirtcaps,http://youtube.com/user/dirtcaps,"http://www.dirtcaps.com

Stan Gravs has fast become a household name synonymous with clubbers all throughout Melbourne. His versatility and knack for being able to drop the right tunes for the right crowd has seen him feature consistently all over Melbourne’s clubbing circuit.

As a 15 year old who enjoyed big-room and progressive house, Stan had already been exposed to a wide array of genres and artists. This is evident in his track selection, which is up there with the best. Some things you just can’t teach...

Four years on and this energetic individual has conquered some of the biggest and best dance floors throughout Melbourne, having supported some major players in the scene including the Stafford Brothers, Hardwell, Havana Brown, TJR and the list goes on. More recently, Stan has been locked away in the studio and has played a major part in the infectious Melbourne Bounce phenomenon that has begun to sweep the clubbing world. Stan has subsequently found his niche within the producers circle in Melbourne. 2013 continues to be a big year for Stan. Keep your eyes and ears peeled on this kid as he is Melbourne’s future. To keep in touch with Stan’s upcoming shows/releases click on the following links.

Bear Grillz,Chill/Mainstream,Bear Grillz,http://soundcloud.com/itsbeargrillz,freeman@circletalentagency.com,"Proving that opposable thumbs or a basic grasp of the human language are not necessary prerequisites for EDM domination, allow us to introduce to you Bear Grillz. He's certainly not your standard 28 year-old grizzly bear... 

Hailing from Yosemite National Park, Grillz's story begins on a typical afternoon spent growling at marmots and eating tourists. While busy trying to digest one particularly tricky mountain climber, he discovered amongst his possessions something called a 'MacBook Pro'. Fast forward 9 months, 6,000 YouTube tutorials and a duck later and we have his debut creation, The 'High Grade' EP!

One of the most successful producers to emerge from the disco-house scene in the 2000's, Grum first rose to fame in 2008 with his hit single 'Heartbeats' before releasing a string of successful singles and remixes over the coming months and years. By the end of 2010 he had a No.1 selling album on iTunes, had been named Best Electronic Artist of the year on iTunes UK, as well as winning a UK music video award. This paired with playing a host of sell out dates that included playing the Creamfields mainstage w/ Tiesto and the mainstage at Ultra w/ Fatboy Slim and Above & Beyond, served to make the producer a virtual mainstay in the dance world.

Since finishing his new album 'Human Touch' Grum has released numerous singles which include 'The Theme' (named one of Annie Mac's 'singles of 2013,' and 'Electro Single Of The Month' in Mixmag,) 'In Love' (which reached number 35 in the Beatport Top 100) the hugely lauded 'Tears,’ ‘Straight To Your Heart’ (Annie Mac’s Special Delivery) and most recently ‘Sunday Blue Sky’ which along with his album is due to be released in 2015. He has also been recently remixing the likes of Second City, Shift K3Y, Above & Beyond, Gareth Emery, Steve Angello, Martin Garrix amongst others.",48348,97,http://www.facebook.com/grummmusic,http://www.facebook.com/grummmusic,http://twitter.com/grummmusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/grummmusic,"http://www.grum.tv

/-|-\ Tropical world sounds for discerning global dancefloor patrons /-|-\

Praise for Calvin Harris ft. Ellie Goulding - Outside (Argüello & Mas Tropical remix):
""Sonically, that's what this remix is—sexy as fuck.""
- Yaqui.co  

Praise for Celeste Stoney - My Kinda Crazy (Mas Tropical remix):
 
""If Pink ever sang salsa, she would sound like Celeste Stoney in this remix—as rockin' cool as she has always been.""

""After selling out The House Of Blues twice and gaining traction in the media, it's no wonder why platinum-selling grammy-winning writer Celeste chose to commission this official remix to Mr. Mas Tropical.""

""We believe pushing the envelope, even if just a bit, is the way to move the genre forward. This unapologetically easy listening and danceable remix is Mas Tropical's part in this quest."" - Yaqui.co

Praise for Fugees - Ready or Not (Mas Tropical remix):

""I guess you could qualify Mas Tropical’s beach-ready take on The Fugees' “Ready or Not” as “throwback of the week”... In any case, I expect it to be a future throwback I’ll have on blast years from now."" -JayelAudio

""Mas Tropical is a newcomer to the Tropical House camp but by the sound of his treatments of songs ... we should keep an eye on him. The original just makes so much sense and the remix sounds so natural."" - yaqui.co

""Mas Tropical is great at what he does because this is FIRE!"" - Musicismylife.com

Having originally gained notoriety among indie blog heads with his remixes and production work under the sub-genre of Blog House, Krames is also known for playing Bass Guitar in his band Village Psychic, and is one half of the hardware-only production duo Power Outage, a Detroit/Chicago House inspired project, currently holding a residency at Cyberia in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

Unlimited Gravity (Ronnie Weberg) is a multi-talented life-long musician originating from the heart of the contemporary electronic music scene, Denver, Colorado. The Unlimited Gravity sound is best described as an ingenious alchemical hybrid, combining the chaotic energy of crunchy crunk beats with the calculated precision and intensity of a classically trained composer. Setting himself apart from the masses, Ronnie has the unique ability to masterfully create the most marvelous dichotomy of sound within each track. Two dynamically oppositional forces are pitted against each other in a musical battle royale; the result is always a titanic struggle of epic proportions from which only Unlimited Gravity could possibly emerge victorious.
Performing live using completely original productions, Ronnie tramples genre boundaries with an energy that is utterly impossible to replicate. Unlimited Gravity adheres to no laws; he defies physics with his musical feats and is helping to usher in a new era of musicality, creativity and originality in electronic music. As Vice President of the Mile High Sound Movement, one of the most influential artist collective groups from Denver, Unlimited Gravity is changing the face of electronic and bass music industry forever.
Ronnie and the President of The Mile High Sound Movement, Jay Jaramillo (Project Aspect) also have a collaborative project titled “Unlimited Aspect”. Unlimited Aspect is an absolutely one of a kind performance, combining the explosive energy of two of Colorado’s most talented artists to form a synthesis of face-melting siren-synths and earth-shaking bass-lines, Project Aspect and Unlimited Gravity are unreservedly the best at what they do.

This sure ain't a farewell tour! It's just the start of the Scandinavian
world conquering mayhem, a Finnish phenomenon called Heavyweight DJ's, with
a capital H. It's about time to dig deep into the basics of having serious fun.

Heavyweight DJ's is a collective of four remarkable performers and EDM artists
called Rascal, Leo Lotsaless, Mista S and Lovetone. The guys have been killing
the dancefloors for huge audiences and major pefromers like LMFAO, David Guetta,
J. Lo and Skrillex all over Finland and Northern hemisphere.

Their latest video
called Butterknife has been hammered at Ministry Of Sound TV and their breakthrough
single called Come Alive has been the most desired track all over the Finnish
national radio YleX and ruled the Top 10 list over 20 weeks.

Despite all the glory, the most important thing is the live performances of the
group. There is nothing similar. You can find the true rock'n'roll spirit with
the stage divings, flying TV's and rest of the madness in the live act. It is
nonsense to describe a thing you just really have to witness.

PS. Parental advisory, don't let your daughters near the venue! There's a vast
change that they will join the movement.

Multi-Platinum selling artist Timmy Trumpet is currently ranked Australia’s #1 DJ (ITM Awards 2015), averaging 10 flights a week, and juggling over 200 shows per year including major clubs and festivals around the world. His latest smash “Freaks” featuring Savage has dominated charts and radio stations in 30+ countries with over 50 million views on YouTube, making it Ministry of Sound’s highest ever selling single. 

No stranger to the limelight, Timmy Trumpet won 'Young Musician of the Year' at age 13 before being granted a full scholarship to the Conservatorium of Music, where Sydney Symphony Orchestra's Anthony Heinrich tutored him. Within two years he secured a position as the leading solo trumpet player in the Australian All-Star Stage Band, taking part in an extensive European tour covering some of the world's biggest Jazz Festivals. After developing perfect pitch at a young age, Timmy's progression into dance music has been propelled by his ability to effortlessly mix in-key whilst mastering the art of improvisation allowing a seamless transition from jazz to dance music.

""After discovering Jazz I began to jam over everything and anything, mainly stuff on the radio. It wasn't long until I discovered house music, met a DJ, and then played my first gig. I drove home that night knowing this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.""

The Live DJ/Trumpet cross-over experiment proved a great success, providing the launching pad for an acclaimed career in dance music production. Timmy now boasts a catalogue of hits including ‘The Buzz’ (Beatport #1) ‘Hipsta’ (ARIA Club #1) ‘Freaks’ (5 x Platinum) as well as a string of successes with labels like Dutch powerhouse Spinnin’ Records, Hussle and Universal Music.

Timmy’s latest collaboration with Carnage and KSHMR ‘Toca’ is due for release ahead of his upcoming US Tour. Having just returned from a recent sold-out European tour and 40+ date North American tour as well as huge successes at home, Timmy is set on bringing his captivating shows to crowds, clubs and festivals for years to come.

RICKY MEARS is no stranger to the stage, but 2016 is slated to be his break-out year under the spotlight. The DJ/Producer/Vocalist phenomenon has amassed quite an impressive resume in his relatively short career in Electronic Music.
  
RICKY MEARS extracts influences from musicians including Brand New, Childish Gambino, Bassnectar, and Skrillex; seamlessly combining them into a unique and memorable style. His originals, such as STRADA, have received praise from some of the largest media outlets in Electronic Music, including multiple releases and premieres from EDM.com. RICKY MEARS’ recent remix for Skip Marley went viral, gaining over 636,000 plays on Soundcloud, bringing his total play count close to 2 million.

Through a combination of hard work, discipline, and unrelenting dedication to his craft, RICKY MEARS continues to capitalize on his ever-gaining momentum and  has managed to acquire collaborations with some of the most influential musicians of our time: Beyoncé, Dj Mustard, Ty Dolla $ign, Skip Marley (Grandson of Bob Marley), Seven Lions, Katy Tiz, and countless others. 

RICKY MEARS has already secured his place alongside some of the greatest of our time,  and this is undoubtedly only the beginning.",7700,13,https://www.facebook.com/rickymearsmusic,https://www.facebook.com/rickymearsmusic,https://twitter.com/RickyMearsMusic,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbdTZ1FfTt8JT3mb-pYI0vg?view_as=subscriber,,6,Paul@numgmt.net

Once, in a land where the tide beat its rhythms out onto a rocky Cornish shore, there were two young boys who wanted more than anything to make people dance. 
Every Friday, after the school bell had rung, they set out with their record bags slung over their boyish shoulders. Together they hunted out caves, raves and illegal happenings. Here they made new friends with long hair, wide eyes and expansive minds. As the rumble of the techno and the rush of the ocean roared in their hearts, the two friends span their vinyl in the mud and firelight, and foraged in the dawn for wisdom, experience, blims and mushrooms. And when these briny nights were over, the two hugged out their brotherly love and crashed out in a tangled dream where bass drunk pirates danced in their heads, and myths of old whispered through their dance-music induced reverie. Boys become lads, lads become youths, youths become men. These men grew beards and marauded around the worlds various coastlines, lands and Kingdoms, weighing anchor in bays of breaks, beats and bass and traded melodies and herbs with the natives. After a long spell at sea they returned to more familiar shores and found a 4/4 scene that was refreshed and rejuvenated.
The good ship KYUBU was launched in 2014, navigating through a sea of mediocrity with TR20 at the helm, recruiting a crew of old sea-dogs and young buccaneers, its mission to spread sabre sharp sounds and treasures of pleasure to the world. KYUBU has been delivering booty, liberating beats ever since. When she rolls into port, no one can resist the urge to dance. As homespun grooves unravel into epic nights beneath the stars, all who step aboard are compelled to move their feet, as KYUBU and the boys dance over the horizon, destined for strange new shores.",5649,124,http://facebook.com/tr20music,http://facebook.com/tr20music,https://twitter.com/tr20music,http://www.youtube.com/user/tr20music,,1,info@gmail.com

James Curd began his DJing career in Chicago when he was only fifteen years old. Being underage, Curd was snuck into events to play at raves and clubs he was not legally allowed in. He played along side some of electronic music’s most respected acts and DJs. Through his love of DJing and music Curd began to write and produce for himself. At nineteen Curd released his first track on the globally respected label “Basenotic” out of Paris. From there Curd created “Greenskeepers”, a name to represent himself and the wide range of music he wrote and the artists he collaborated with.

As “Greenskeepers” Curd released an array of music on Classic records. He made his mark on the dance music world by infusing swing music and Chicago house to invent the term G-Swing, being short for Greenskeepers Swing. Curd focused on G-Swing and started a label by that same name to feature this unique sound. Around this same time Curd also owned and operated two other record labels “Igloo” and “Greenskeepers Music”.

Curd has released four full length albums under Greenskeepers, “Ziggy Franklin Radio Show”, “Pleetch”, “Polo Club” and “Live Like You Want To Live”. Curd has also had phenomenal individual success with releases on DFA, Permanent Vacation, Exploited, Eskimo, ETC ETC, Bang Gang, OM, Ministry Of Sound, to name a few. Curd is also highly sought after for his remixes. He has remixed artist such as Juan Maclean, PNAU, Midnight Magic, Poolside, Kaskade, Hercules & Love Affair, Groove Armada, Flight Facilities and more. Curd’s music has also been remixed by great artist like Poolside, Flosstradamus, Juan Maclean, Gigamesh, Treasure Fingers, Pepe Bradock, The Rapture, Dimitri From Paris, Flight Facilities and Derrick Carter.

Four of Curd’s songs have been featured on “Grey’s Anatomy”, while others have appeared on T.V shows such as C.S.I Miami, Point Pleasant, MTV Real World and Keeping Up With The Kardashians. His music can also be found in foreign films as well as main stream movies such as “What Happens In Vegas”,”The Vow” and the hugely successful animation “The Incredibles”. If you listen carefully, you will even find Curd’s work on BBC documentaries and American Airlines inflight radio! His work in T.V. and Film has enabled him to work behind the scenes as a music supervisor. His latest film “Crush” is produced by Intrepid Pictures and features an amazing array of artist from around the world hand picked by Curd to fit each scene perfectly.

Curd has toured the world over, renown for his energy behind the decks and his ability to make a party. Curd has performed at some of the world’s most respected clubs. From Fabric in London, The Avalon in Los Angeles, Home in Sydney to The Arches in Glasgow. Curd has also been part of festivals such as Park Life in Australia, Lollapalooza In Chicago, T In The Park in Scotland and Electric Picnic in Ireland.

Curd continues to consistently release quality new music by pushing his sound while also staying true to his roots. He has started a new band called “Favored Nations” with singer Morgan Phalen who has also worked with Justice and Phenomenal Handclap Band. The third bandmate is Sid Who?, who also plays bass and guitar for Empire Of The Sun. Curd is also putting together a mix CD coming soon on Ministry Of Sound. With Curd anything and everything can be expected. Whether it’s Rockstar Games using his song for the “Grand Theft Auto 4” Ad campaign or his latest EP sitting at number one on Juno, you never know what to expect from the talented Curd or where his music might pop up.

""Evolution is inevitable for any lasting form of artistic expression. Colorado bass music artist AOWL is holding the reins for today’s transformation of dubstep styles. A member of the US Army, Kaleb Mere is also a soldier on the front lines of the underground. The DJ/Producer draws inspiration from classic meditative styles as well as the aggressive “riddim” style, fusing the traditions into a sinister style that is all his own. At once deep and wonky, AOWL’s tunes ring of dubstep’s future. His ear for innovation is at the heart of his Mile High Sound Movement label, a collective committed to exposing open ears to the wealth of young local talent emerging from the Colorado scene. AOWL’s dark aesthetic reflects his fascination with 1950’s horror movies. His recent addition to the Sub.Agency roster is a sign of treacherous things impending from the young artist.""",5325,60,http://www.facebook.com/TheOfficialAOWL,http://www.facebook.com/TheOfficialAOWL,https://twitter.com/aowldubs,,,3,mhcbookings@gmail.com

Mr. Mendel,Chill/Mainstream,Mr Mendel,http://soundcloud.com/mendel,hello@sensethereal.com,"Mr Mendel is a DJ who is exceptionally dedicated to his craft. Always in search of those special pieces of music to love. Driven by the philosophy of playing music because it moves you emotionally and physically and bringing that heartfelt music to the dance floor. 

Growing up in Amsterdam, Mr Mendel’s first influences were found in hiphop. Later when he worked at Waxwell Records, he got further introduced to many styles of music, broadening his musical horizon from Brazil to Afro, Soul and Disco to House. Mr Mendel’s selections are characterized by passionate and intriguing tunes. In his sets you can recognize his diverse influences, from Amsterdam’s soulful school of DJs like Hunee, Antal & Marcel Vogel. To Chicago’s (ware)house DJs like Rahaan, Sadar Bahar & Ron Trent. 

The last two years Mr Mendel has been touring extensively through Europe and beyond. In the meantime he released edits on Lumberjacks in Hell, Disco Deviance and Basic Fingers, as well as curated the tropical playlist for 22tracks Amsterdam. He is currently in the studio working on his own material, due in 2016...

mathias@circuscompany.fr

Growing up in Texas and the Caribbean, Brian Brewster became associated with music
at a young age. Starting out as a reggae, dancehall, and hip hop singer, it wasn’t until
2005 when he moved to Paris that he would become connected with electronic music.
After meeting dOP in the French capital he began to spend a lot of time with the trio in
the studio and in 2010 Aquarius Heaven was born. The sound particularly interested
Brian because there were fewer limitations in electronic music and it gave him room to
experiment. He was able to push the boundaries of sound to create something outside of
the box of the typical house and techno machine. Never forgetting about his roots in
music you can still hear the colors of the Caribbean in his vocals.
After relocating to Berlin his first track “Before U Go” was released on the Watergate 06
compilation mixed by dOP. Shortly after that his debut full length EP was release on
Circus Company titled 7 days. The follow up to 7 days on Wolf + Lamb even further
catapulted him into the spotlight with a dark and sexy music video that created a lot of
buzz in the music-blog world before the EP was even released. Since his quick rise in the
ranks of the world of electronic music Aquarius Heaven has collaborated with some of the
best in the industry including Miss Kittin, Ryan Crosson, Art Department, Mathias Kaden
and many more. He continues to build a strong body of work on some of the most well
known and respect labels such as Circus Company, Crosstown Rebels, Visionquest, and
No. 19 Music.
Shining brightly as one of the stand out vocalists and performers in the scene Aquarius
Heaven has traveled the globe and back performing at some of the biggest clubs and
festivals such as Panorama Bar, Rex, Space, Watergate, and Zur wilden Renate to name
a few. Always in the studio pushing himself to the absolute limit he continues to push out
a high volume of quality work with two upcoming EPs in the new year one on his home
label Circus Company and another on Rhythm Cult. Showing no signs of slowing down
you can expect to continue to see Aquarius Heaven at the top of his game as a staple of
the electronic music world.

MANIK,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/manik_nyc,max@amsbooking.fr,"New York City's very own MANIK fired onto the scene back in 2011 with releases on Ovum, Poker Flat, Hot Creations and LA based Culprit. The Queens native was consequently named one of 5 breakout stars by DJ Mag that year. His diverse production sound is somewhere between classic house, groovey techno, acid, and a bit of funk & disco- never pigeonholed- he is a true Music Producer/DJ who's tastes reach beyond the dance-floor.

Throughout the years, he's released on the worlds top underground labels: Ovum, Bpitch Control, Hot Creations, and Poker Flat just to name a few. Keeping up the momentum in 2015, his BPM DJ Set at the Ovum night received praise when it took the top spot on ""THUMP's Top 10 overall Sets"" from the Festival. In May, he released the ""Tokyo EP"" on Nice Age- the label run by Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs. The breakout single on the EP ""Buffalo Trace"" was hammered on BBC Radio 1 by tastemakers Annie Mac and Pete Tong. Furthermore, his summer edit series involving Janet Jackson edit/reworks garnered much acclaim on XLR8R by placing #1 and #10 overall on the Top 100 Downloads of 2015.

As a DJ, MANIK's international profile has risen just as quickly. Having played at Panorama Bar Berlin, Womb Tokyo, Fabric London, Revolver Melbourne, Q Nightclub Seattle, filling clubs in almost seventy five cities across the globe. This fast rising musician continues to bring his unique brand of house and techno, old school and new school, expertly crafted music to the dance-floor.

Having relocated from New York to Los Angeles, he's continued to mature as an artist. The sounds of MANIK can be found in the crates of the worlds leading underground DJs and tastemakers; Ellen Allien, Steve Bug, Jamie Jones, Claude Von Stroke, Heidi, and Josh Wink all being regular supporters.

With a steady stream of music in 2016, MANIK will see his sixth release on Ovum entitled ""Recourse EP"" which features Cari Golden on vocals, a brand new EP on the legendary Poker Flat Recordings, and his follow up release on Berlin based Bpitch Control. Combining this unrelenting passion and consistent quality over quantity, MANIK continues his limitless global rise.""

DJ, producer, remixer, record label head honcho and 3 times Olympic Gin & Tonic champion, Dicky Trisco is addicted to the way music connects people and makes for better days. A night owl since he was born, he has devoted his life to mastering the ways of the night and the art of the discotheque.

As a disc jockey, DT packs a little bit of everything into his sets and is committed to the idea that music and club nights should be all about collective joy and ecstasy. Some call it having a good time.

Disco music has always been at the forefront of his musical passions, although he is a lover of all sorts. For him Disco is a state of mind, a place where people mix, let loose, hang out and dance like maniacs all night long. The kind of place we all need to find now and again to recharge the batteries…

These days Dicky tours the world constantly looking for the next party…often with his DJ partner and fellow disco deviant, Pete Herbert. Pedro & Dicky have produced many tracks, remixes and reworks together, as well as knocking out countless DJ mixes. They play regularly together back to back and all night long, and have turned up for numerous late night hotel breakfasts still in peak condition.

Whether it be beach parties, after parties, underground disco dens, super clubs, supper clubs, hippie markets or festivals, DT is always ready to rock the dance floor and has done so all around the world with regular tours to South America, Japan, China, South -East Asia, Australia and the USA as well as all over Europe and the UK. Plus annual appearances at events like Mareh Festival, Electric Elephant, Festival No 6, Glastonbury and out in Ibiza at super clubs like Space.

Enough words.

Hell Yeah Recordings,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/hell-yeah,info@hellyeahrec.it,"""If you didn't know, Hell Yeah is the Italian label hell-bent on releasing the best modern disco(ish) you can find. Sometimes it's blissed out and Balearic, sometimes it's squelchy and down-right weird and sometimes it's the sort of enlogated, tribal stuff that works dancefloors into a salacious frenzy"" (Kristan J Caryl - DJ MAG January 2014)


Hell Yeah Recordings, a descendent of leading Italian dance label Mantra Vibes is an Italian-based electronic music label active since 2006. Releasing from Ferrara, Bologna, and Amsterdam and led by Marco Gallerani “peeDoo” (A&R), the label bases its philosophy on a diversity of artists and recording experiences tied together by a common vision of what defines quality progressive recording. 

With a sound as diverse as the artists it represents, Hell Yeah does not limit itself to the constraints of genre but packs a complex palette of sounds ranging from techno to minimal-nu-rave to electro-funk and tech house.  Artists as varied as Radio Slave, Santos, Umek, Oliver Koletzki, Congorock, 3iO, Crimea X and the mighty Balearic Gabba Sound System have helped establish Hell Yeah’s eclectic sound, a distinct take on party music loaded with a sonic Balearic feel good vibe that has made press around the world hail Hell Yeah as a label to watch, always

Hell Yeah aims to build upon its current reputation as a leading Italian Electronic Music play, overseeing the release of a series of progressive productions that straddle genres, defy conventions and blur barriers between listening and dance music. Stemming from Hell Yeah’s initial graphic identity formed by Neverending’s Rocco “the Boghe” Pezzella, new mind-bending web and label artworks from Italian artist Andrea Amaducci and the Berlin-based Ice Cream For Free collective promises complete visual as well as aural stimulation.

Michael McKenna (Keep Schtum)
Michael McKenna is a DJ and producer from Dublin and is probably best known by his 'Keep Schtum' pseudonym. His hugely popular disco re-edits have been getting support from DJ's worldwide, including Greg Wilson and DJ Harvey.
Keep Schtum's re-edit of 'Hang Together' by Odyssey has become a widely played Disco classic. The re-edit of 'Do It Any Way Yo Wanna' by People's Choice got the stamp of approval by Gamble and Huff themselves, when included on the 'Philadelphia International: The Re-Edits' album, released on Harmless Records.

Michael's had a number of other well received vinyl and digital releases, both re-edits and original productions. They often, but not always, fall somewhere between Disco and House. The most recent being the 'Real Change' Ep. with Dublin DJ Bubbles, released on 'Paper Recordings' offshoot 'Paper Disco'. He now has a busy summer ahead of him with a few remixes due out, and DJ set's at most of the main Irish music festivals.

As well as the occasional gig in the UK and Europe, Michael Dj's around Ireland and has several monthly DJ residencies in Dublin, including Pygmalion, Izakaya, Liqour Rooms, Soder & Ko and Ukiyo.

Navid Izadi,Chill/Mainstream,Navid Izadi,http://soundcloud.com/navizadi,inbal@windishagency.com,"Navid Izadi is a young man who possesses wisdom and natural flair beyond his years. The funk is embedded in this performer’s DNA; he commands the stage with charisma, contagious energy and overwhelming presence, channelling the spirits of his idols while presenting a contemporary take on forms of music that speak to your very soul. We’re talking true funk, soul, disco, hip-hop, music from the heart, from the streets, from real people with real emotions – intertwined with the analogue power of synthesizers and modern-day software, which take the sound into the future… 

As a member of the Crew Love entourage, this former San Francisco club kid has flourished, taking full charge of his dynamic live show and presenting it to audiences all over the world, from Tokyo to Colombia, to London, San Francisco, Milan, Montreal, and everywhere in between. His touring has been extensive to say the least, and each experience has fed back into both his live set - which improves and evolves with every new performance - and his studio experimentations. Together with this, the visual aspect of his performances is also crucial to Navid’s output; exotic headdresses, flamboyant outfits, crowd interaction, rigorous dance moves, infectious energy and rousing vocals delivered in tandem with the dopest rhythms. 

Rolling as a DJ, singer, rapper, and producer of music that effortlessly weaves between influences, you’re never quite sure what to expect from Navid. Aside from collaborations with the likes of Psychemagik, Deniz Kurtel, Soul Clap and PillowTalk, Navid has also handled remix duties for artists like Miguel Migs, Midnight Magic, Pezzner, No Regular Play, Wolf + Lamb and more. Last year also saw the artist pick up the coveted Essential New Tune award on Pete Tong’s Radio 1 show, when Heidi selected ‘Feelin' Purple (Soul Clap Remix)’ as her choice during a cover show. 

The future holds much more in store with more EPs lined up for the Crew Love family of labels (W+L, Soul Clap Records, W+L Black, and Double Standard) as well as a full-length album that will see the young Renaissance man stretching his musical legs far and wide. If you think you’ve heard it all, think again, Navid’s musical locker is brimming with influences and inspirations – from the psychedelic funk of the great George Clinton, through to rugged rap legends like Rakim. The album promises to be a compendium of everything that makes Navid what he is and more, as he retraces the steps he’s taken to reach the point he’s at now while keeping a firm focus on where he’s headed. Expanding beyond genres, his opus will be closely aligned with the unifying element between all of his influences; black music with soul, which permeates into so many different styles of music today. 

In the meantime expect an eclectic slew of new music flowing out of the Izadi laboratory; a collaborative EP with Deniz Kurtel, contributions to the Crew Love compilation, some undercover hip-hop productions, Turkish funk edits, a dark wave-inspired soundtrack LP, P-funk and much more. There’s no stopping this whirlwind of creativity now he’s started.

With just the right balance of confidence, determination, skill, musical knowledge and intellect Navid, is carving out his own niche and an artist who will leave you with indelible memories of each scintillating performance…

Emanuele Carrieri aka Dankann: 

Fascinated by the trance mood and influenced by the sound of progressive house, Dankann mixes different styles together to create impressive, mind blowing tracks. His natural talent and passion for music are expressed when he states that the quest for the perfect melody is crucial to his productions as the right melody has the power of mirroring and amplifying human emotions.

After having dabbled in music for a few years and having earned himself a nomination for “Most Promising Artist” at the 2009 Beatport Awards, Dankann came to a turning point in his career when he started working with legendary trance producer Antillas in 2010.
The Antillas & Dankann team efforts resulted in the massive singles: “Evolution”, “Synapse”, “When You Love Someone” licensed also to 'Sony Music Canada'; The several top remixes are for the likes of Armin van Buuren, BT, Andy Moor, Markus Shulz, Solarstone, Emma Hewitt, and more via Armada, the world’s finest EDM label. The 2014 started great with the new single 'And God Said', supported and played by W&W, Armin Van Buuren, Marlo, Jesse Voorn and many more... He is currently working on new tracks and collaborations ... expect big news, stay tuned ...

San Francisco three ­piece live band PillowTalk are surprising dance music treasures. Manipulating pop melodies, classic R&B, soul and boogie into the loose rhythms of house music and performing live on stages in nightclub settings across the world, they have bridged an
impossible gulf between worlds and created new expectations for electronic producers and live musicians alike.

Their success is two­fold, for not only are they stand out performers capturing the stage with Sammy D’s bold and sultry vocals, with multi-instrumentalist Ryan Williams’ dexterous guitar and keys, and with Mikey Tello’s fluid synth work (not to mention their matching classic black tie attire) – they are also musical chameleons. As comfortable creating the upbeat 80s ­inspired synth­pop heard in lead single ‘Lullaby’, as they are in the psychedelic funk of ‘We All Have Rhythm’, and the classic rock and roll of ‘Devil’s Run’, PillowTalk also adeptly deliver slow electronic ballads (‘Naive’) and house driven anthems (‘If I Try’) for their eloquent debut LP, ‘Je Ne Sais Quoi’ on their home label Wolf + Lamb.

A soundtrack to long nights, lazy days and the hazy space between sleeping and waking, the record spans everything you want from the band: sun­splashed jams, peak ­time party tunes and low ­lit moments of intimacy.",46899,39,https://www.facebook.com/Pillowtalkforever,https://www.facebook.com/Pillowtalkforever,https://twitter.com/ptalkforever,,"http://www.bandsintown.com/PillowTalk

The UK duo, known for their beautiful production work, prolific remixing skills, obscenely vast record collections, and transcendent mixtape journeys, are being heralded as a truly unique and positive presence in today's music scenes.

""Stars Of 2012' - Mixmag

Psychemagik's first appearance on wax was an edit of Fleetwood Mac's 'Everywhere', which quickly found its way into the record bags of veterans like Tom Middleton and Greg Wilson. The duo have since released an impressive array of highly acclaimed original productions, remixes and edits. They now regularly play at major festivals, clubs and special events around the globe. Including two USA Tours in the first half of 2013.

“Fucking Brilliant” - DJ Mag

Their studio output is prolific to say the least; original productions such as Valley Of Paradise and the Lunar Escape EP, recent remix projects include Bryan Ferry, Haim, Boy George, Mirror People, Azari & III, Metronomy, Kauf and Mirror People.

""First-choice remixers that crisscross genres and scene affiliations"" - Thump

And then there’s the edits. Their recent version of Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’, a follow up to ‘Everywhere’, topped the Hype Machine charts and has gained some serious props from around the globe. They have also released a whole host of edits on their Healin’ Feelin and Discotheque Wreckers imprints, all of which made the Juno top sellers list.

""Spectacular ...such class and style"" – KCRW

Their mixes paint the story of two extraordinarily talented and passionate guys. Some blatantly show that Psychemagik can absolutely dominate a dancefloor. Others, like their guest mixes for the Test Pressing podcast, are gorgeously composed psychedelic experiences, which give you an idea of just how deep and amazing their record collections really are. Basically, you can bet that they have the perfect record for any time and any place.

""Perfectly deconstructed Hot Chip's sound for their support slot…Fantastic!""– Songkick

They also have a reputation as the go to guys for mega rare records and samples that you won't find anywhere else. Their satisfied customers include 2 Many Dj's/Soulwax, Chemical Brothers, Q-Tip, Fake Blood amongst many others.

It is this incredible ear for musical treasures and their dedication to the art of digging that has lead to the success of their recent compilations, Psychemagik Presents: ‘Magik Cyrkles’ and Psychemagik Presents: ‘Magik Sunrise’ on Leng Records, both of which sold out worldwide on vinyl within hours of release and featured in the top 5 of most good record shops bestsellers lists.

With a wealth of upcoming releases just around the corner, they've already set the controls for the heart of the sun and will be heading into a whole new stratosphere of creativity.

MATZINGHA steht für den Moment. 
Den Moment zwischen Traum und Tanz – Dort ist er Zuhause und verwandelt seine Eindrücke in Klangbilder, welche erahnen lassen wie Berlin klingt – Wenn man genau hinhört.

In der Stadt aus Farben und Klängen, aus Träumen und Ängsten ist er geboren und aufgewachsen.
MATZINGHA hat sich schon immer gerne von der Vielschichtigkeit inspirieren lassen und sich seine ganz eigene Meinung zu dieser kontroversen Stadt gebildet.

Seit 2010 arbeitet der junge Künstler an seinem eigenen Stil, dem sogenannten „Urban Electro“ – welcher mit der Zeit genauso an Tiefe und Charakter gewonnen hat, wie MATZINGHA selbst. 

Er begeistert sein Publikum nicht nur mit seinen „Therapiestunden“-Sets, die er seit knapp 3 Jahren in regelmäßigen Abständen veröffentlicht, sondern auch mit seinen eigenen, einfühlsamen Produktionen, welchen er sich seit einiger Zeit intensiv widmet.
Mit seinem Talent für emotionale Musik, erschafft er immer wieder Raum für Bewegung – Bewegung für Körper und Geist – und entführt sein Publikum für einen kurzen Augenblick zurück zu sich selbst.
______________________________

MATZINGHA and his music stands for the moment. The moment between dream and dance – He transforms his impressions into music which gives the audience the idea of „Berlin-Sound“.
Born and raised in the city of colour and sound MATZINGHA has always been inspired by the contrasts and started making his own opinion about the controversial city. Since 2010 the young artist is creating his own style, ""Urban Electro"". His electronic music has gained depth and character over the time same as he as a person. He delights his listeners not only with his ""therapy sessions"" sets which he’s publishing at regular intervals for almost 3 years but also with his ow, sensitive outputs.
With his talent for emotional music he creates room for movement - movement for the body and soul. At least for a moment.",7625,95,http://www.facebook.com/MATZINGHA/,http://www.facebook.com/MATZINGHA/,http://twitter.com/#!/matzingha,http://www.youtube.com/user/Matzingha,"http://hearthis.at/matzingha/

After moving to Melbourne, Australia from New Zealand in 2004, originally as an aspiring guitarist, HEATH‘S musical path in life was soon smashed out of the park by the discovery of the world of EDM Music. After which Heath got straight down to business, and thank the lord he did!
His career to date has seen him play at almost every club in Melbourne as well as Australia’s biggest festivals – from STEROSONIC, to SUMADAYZE, SUPAFEST to SIDETRACKED at the GRAND PRIX.

HEATH’S evolving career took a rather large turn in 2010 when he was polled 6th in Australia’s INTHEMIX TOP 50 DJ‘s competition, a satisfying achievement for this Melbournian luminary. With this charismatic Kiwi’s musical talent, comes a driving mentality to achieve. Harnessing this musical beast is now our punishment in life for entering artist management – but truth be told, the guy’s a genius.

His enthusiasm towards his production sees him spilling out track, after track, after track! He’s had releases on a multitude of major Australian labels, the likes of One Love / Freakshow Disco / Central Station / Downright / Bush / Hussle / Velcro / Ministry of Sound and has remixed the likes of JAM EXPRESS, GT, T-REK, SLOP ROCK, JEALOUS MUCH? and STAFFORD BROTHERS, the list goes on.

His style is so dynamic he can cater to a main stage festival crowd with his Big Room / Electro, and then turn around and play a Boiler Room set of dirty, deep house that will leave you speechless. Let us whisk you away for an experience that’s just as much for the mind as it is for the body.",20449,20,https://www.facebook.com/heathrenata,https://www.facebook.com/heathrenata,,,,3,bookings@milkfed.com

Starting off on his acoustic guitar and vocals at a young age, his passion for music has seen him make a  musical transition into anything electronic.

His talent and passion for music production has given him the opportunity to play his music to club goers around Melbourne and many other Electronic music loving towns around Australia!

Here is a list of some of the places that have seen and heard him do his thing!

Billboard, Fake Tits at Tramp, Cloud Nine, Lab22, Noizy Neighbours, Wah Thursdays, Wah Saturdays, Hidden Forest, Mischief Makers, Korova Saturdays, TFF at Huha in Bendigo, Haida Bar in Ballarat, Chalk Saturdays and Chinese Whispers in Geelong and many more. 

He has had numerous tracks released through labels such as Club Cartel, which saw him climb the Beatport, Electro House charts when “Houston” (his collaboration with Loutaa) reached #29! Making it the labels 3rd highest selling single. Other labels include:
Preston Recordings, PhetHouse Records, Pop Rox Muzik, Safari Music and Twisted Plastic Recordings.

With a new spring in his step and his eyes on the prize, 2015 is set to be a great year for this Young gun ;)

Sawgood,Chill/Mainstream,Clement M,http://soundcloud.com/sawgood,randy@hook-up.fr,"SAWGOOD
French electro producer, Sawgood was born in March 2009; only one month later his dirty sound destroyed the Kissy Sell Out Show on BBC Radio 1, Loca Fm, Urban Fabric Fm and a lot of web radios.
His style is between dark electro, with a loud atmosphere, and happy drum'n bass, intented for dancefloor. He’s loved by novices and initiated. We can easily recognize his touch with his loud basses and his punchy drums.

Sawgood, connu pour son electro sombre, ravageuse et énergique, démarre rapidement son ascension dans le monde de l'EDM, ses premières sorties et collaborations avec notamment Gigi Barroco et Calvertron, le propulse directement en haut des charts. Il enchaine ensuite les remix pour South Central, Toxic Avenger, ou encore Orelsan, ce qui, avec son arrivée au sein des labels Oh My God It's Techno Music et Freakz Me Out aux cotés de Cyberpunkers, le pose comme étant un des français à surveiller en 2013.

MANTIS, REPPIN THE ATL





Taylor Scott and Paul Ollinger, known as Mantis, are a relentless duo. Having begun their musical careers with metal & deathcore, the transition to heavy bass music was not so much a step down in intensity, but a slide into a world with spectacular tools to mix dense layers of music in new ways, and deploy it with force. Mantis was formed in early 2011 to test the boundaries of metal-influenced production, and plunge the result into a wash of haunting atmospheres. Mantis wants to provide “music to make you feel like you’re somewhere else, and you’ve never been more stoked to be there.”


With that target in sight, 2011 was a smashing first year; the momentum began in Atlanta, and overflowed with releases on labels such as Play Me, Heavy Artillery, BroTown Records, & Abducted Records. A standard was set with 2011's ""All Worlds"", their first EP, breaking the top 10 on Beatport's Dubstep releases, and held with 2012's ""Futures"" scoring #5 on Beatport's overall chart. The support of tastemakers such as Liquid Stranger, Downlink, Figure, Cyberoptics, Diesel, Genetix, Persist, & Sluggo, points to an accomplishment of musical influence on an international scale, and the potential for much more.

A history in Atlanta's metal scene, playing in acts such as WLTP and Attila, provides Mantis' cornerstone of fierce stage skills. Having become known across the USA for throwing down an aggressive live show with unmatched energy and only the heaviest bass music, Mantis' reputation stands as being one of the gnarliest new production teams in the scene. 

With packed crowds at hand, and Beatport charts at their feet, only one goal remains- to raise the awareness of metal-influenced bass music... oh, and world domination.",38343,81,http://www.facebook.com/mantisdubstep,http://www.facebook.com/mantisdubstep,,http://www.youtube.com/user/mantisatl,"http://www.mantisdubstep.com

Ganja White Night,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/ganjawhitenight,max@backinthedayz.be,"Ganja White Night is an electronic music band whose early influences are found at the roots of ""Bass-Music"". During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album ""Addiction"" in 2014. 

They decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to ""Dubstep"" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album ""Hybrid Distillery"" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director ""Ebola - Delit2fuite"" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.

Stefan Dabruck,Chill/Mainstream,Stefan Dabruck,http://soundcloud.com/stefan-dabruck,bookings@adjustedartistmanagement.com,"Biografie
That the life of Stefan Dabruck is in the instance shaped by music, is demonstrated by the intensity with which he conducts his profession. 

Since working in the music business for over 13 years, he was for almost a decade Germanys leading A& man at the former most successful club label Superstar Recordings. In 2009 he decided to establish the Label WePlay with Elmar Braun and Frank Klein, which was twice (2010 & 2011) awarded Germanys best dance label 'prize'. Signings for artist like Axwell, Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso, Laidback Luke, Laserkraft 3D and the full 'cream' of the international house scene, rewarded him with more than 20 gold records and several international awards. Besides WePlay he is also well-known as the manager of big-ones like Tocadisco, Jean Elan or Laserkraft 3D. 

But also as a producer Stefan is able to look back on more than 100 releases in the last few years. With remixes from international artists like Moby, Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, Bob Sinclar, Public Enemy, Dada Life and Armin van Buuren. Through these remixes and a range of unions with quite a few famous guys, Armada and the management around Armin van Buuren had a look at him. In 2011 the debut album “2:48 am” from Dabruck & Klein appeared on WePlay/Armada and was very successful, selling in more than 20 countries. For their success so far, Armada presented them with the honour of releasing the prestige album “Dabruck and Klein´s hands on Armada”. A remix album with his remixes from classics like Binary Finary or Greece 2000.

As a DJ Stefan has travelled across all of the major continents and has completed more than 1000 DJ-Gigs with Dabruck & Klein in the last 10 years. In 2010/2011 alonenhe traveled to more than 20 countries and played from the familiar club to the big festivals always with distinction. In a list of festivals like Armada Night, Netherlands; Loveparade, Germany; Soundtropolis, Germany, a MOS Tour in Australia, Motorockr Festival, China; Day & Night Festival, Austria and clubs like Webstar Hall, New York; Ivy, Sydney; Suzie Wong, Peking; Twighlight, Dubai; Koko, London or the Queens Club, Paris. 

Although he is working simultaneously on the new Dabruck & Klein album, his focus in 2012 will be on solo releases and DJ performances as Stefan Dabruck. 
His first single “Bullet” in conjunction with Christian Burns plus his remix for Lenny Kravitz´s Track “Superlove” will be released shortly. Furthermore there will be a dozen future releases, through which we will hear a lot of things from Stefan Dabruck in the near future.

BIOGRAPHY
Sandra Collins’ in-demand DJing has kept her constantly globetrotting— everywhere from New Zealand to Romania to Mexico. What began as a humble interest morphed into serious business in the 90’s, when Sandra Collins emerged as one of the Los Angeles rave scene’s major players. Sandra is now, without question, one of the most recognized and beloved DJs in the business.

With her incessant worldwide touring, massive press coverage and hundreds of thousands of albums sold, Sandra has solidified her place as one of the most well-known female DJs in the world. The DanceStar Awards awarded her the 2003 Best DJ award over the likes of Louie Devito, Deep Dish and Bad Boy Bill among others. This award is part of a long list of stellar career achievements, which include URB Magazine’s 1999 “Best Female Artist,” an honor she shared with Lauryn Hill. She also hosted the International Dance Music Awards in 2006 with Daniel Glass.

Whenever Sandra’s on the decks, you know you’re in for an unforgettable evening. She held a massively popular residency at legendary NYC club Twilo alongside Sasha & Digweed and Paul Van Dyk. Her memorable sets, such as the six-hour set following Moby in front of 80,000 fans at the ’99 Woodstock Festival, as well as Coachella in 2002 and 2008, are evidence of her ability to convert those new to the scene into true electronic music fans. In 2005, Sandra created an audio-visual collaboration with VJ Vello Virkhaus called “Sv2 Presents: Interference.” This groundbreaking technical show integrated Sandra’s mixing with over a hundred videos created by her and Virkhaus. The cutting-edge show toured for 3 years, garnering much praise, a DJ Times cover and sponsorships from companies like Pioneer and Edirol.

Sandra’s popularity and reputation for bringing out the deeply emotional side of house and techno has earned her a worldwide following. A tireless experimenter who is always in search of new sounds and platforms for her music, Sandra is in a class of her own, whether she’s performing at a music festival, a 10,000-person super club, or an intimate gallery space. She has become a true ambassador for American electronic music.",11201,32,https://www.facebook.com/djsandracollins,https://www.facebook.com/djsandracollins,https://twitter.com/djsandracollins,https://www.youtube.com/user/djsandracollins,"http://www.djsandracollins.com

@subdotmission

Hailing from the depths of Denver, the Colorado native has become a staple in the electronic music scene throughout the state and has established himself as one of the rawest talents pushing true innovative sound throughout the area. No stranger to the dubstep scene, Swayd is a multi-faceted artist that is known to also dabble in the Trap scene and get dirty with his 808 style! 

Drawing inspiration from some of the top heavy-hitters in the industry like Funtcase, Datsik, Rusko, Downlink, Luminox, Point.Blank, & Emalkay-  Swayd has crafted a signature bass-heavy sound of his own with a wonky-style that gets crowds bouncing off the walls from beginning to end! 

Dating back to his debut performance when Swayd held it down on the local support for Bloodthinnerz & Sadhu in January of 2014, the producer has gained massive momentum on the local circuit and attracted attention and backing from some of the top crews in Colorado. Today you can catch Swayd putting in work behind the decks as a resident DJ for Sub.mission.  He is also an active member of both the 'Mile High Club' and 'Periodics' artist collectives. 

Fueled by his love for heart-thumping bass and his own constant creative output, Swayd is one of the most innovative and well-rounded talents on the scene today and his sound can not be mistaken! Identified as the mastermind behind massive tunes like ‘Back Off’ , ‘Hotpockets’ & 'Eradicate’ the young artist pushes boundaries with each of his productions and truly stands out among fellow dubstep acts. Commonly identified for his massive collaborations alongside artists like Cubs, SampliFire, Bommer, Asixe, Sinehound, Scarfaze, & Zaita. Swayd’s tunes have been rinsed on some of the biggest platforms and the artist has certified features on premier Dubstep channels like ‘The Dub Rebellion’ and 'EDM.com' under his belt.  


 Since his induction to the realm of underground Dubstep only a few short years ago, Swayd has risen to become one of the most exciting talents and gained support from don’s such as JPehlpz, Coffi, Dubloadz, Bommer, & more!  


Having conquered some of the most premier venues in the state such as, Cervantes’ Other Side, City Hall, Quixotes True Blue, Club Vinyl, and the Sick Puppy Saloon, Swayd can set off any audience and is known to leave a lasting imprint on the crowds that he annihilates. Armed with an arsenal of hard-hitting original material, Swayd packs heat at every single performance and is guaranteed to make you get low!  Whenever you see the name ‘Swayd’ on a lineup, brace yourselves- he does NOT mess around! 

2015 is already stacking up to be one of the brightest and most promising years for Swayd and you can assure yourself that there is big things on the horizon for the young DJ/Producer! Whether he is busy in the lab cranking out dance floor bangers or slaying the local crowds at Electronic Tuesdays, Swayd will continue to develop his signature sound and prove that he is a true force to be reckoned with!

“Caught between two worlds …” is not the most convenient place for most musicians. That, however, is where Oscar OZZ has felt most comfortable for years. Whether Deep House, Tech House, Indie Dance or Minimal: the most important thing is that it grooves, is catchy and rocks the dance floor! His gigs at the hottest clubs in the country as well as his gigs abroad in Mexico, Bolivia, Spain, Belgium, Holland, Norway etc. have also been highly praised in retrospect, just like his regular festival appearances at e.g. SonneMondSterne, Sputnik Springbreak or Summerspirit.

Every year many tracks appear, mostly on vinyl, and sweeten up – not only in this country – music lovers’ lives. Oscar’s discography is very comprehensive and includes famous productions on many different labels such as Katermukke, Material Series, Confused, Perc Trax, Superfancy, BlackFoxMusic. Oscar OZZ is also known and notorious for his edits, which are distributed to a large fan base (> 5000 subscriber) free of charge on a monthly basis through his newsletter. Songs from many artists have thus had the pleasure to be enhanced for the DJ world.

Since 2003 Oscar OZZ is running different imprints like Karatemusik, KarateKlub, Lørdag, Kol Mojito, Extrasmart, Tape Select or OZZ Records. He’s also working together with different artists like Ron Flatter, Patrick Brosin, etc. to bring up their labels like Pour La Vie or .defaultbox  to the top.  Most of the tracks were released on vinyl and digital. The complete administrative stuff, like handling with pressing plants and digital distribution and accounting is managed successfully through Oscar OZZ.

RomeoFoxtrott is a project established by two artists from ""Sunshine Valley"" ;)(Germany). The producer duo of Felix Tollkühn and Rico Solo was born in 2011 and since then the two are working together very harmoniously. They feel connected by sharing a certain background that influenced both of them, and which had its beginning in the 90s. During that time they both got their first experiences on turntables (“1210”) and drum-computers. The love for Dope-Beats turned into passion, which influences their career ever since. 

In the following years their sound started to be more experimental and crossed with electronic beats. This change in style was not just due to new and different taste, but because of subjective cordiality and positive imagination of electronical music. Being open minded enables these two producers to discover a highly diverse range of music. Nowadays their sets establish a deep, melodic, playful and progressive groove. Their first EP ""Memories"" was released in spring 2012. The EP was published by their own label ""Hunting For Emotion"" and has caused quite a stir in the global house-scene. 

Besides working on their own productions they released a couple of remixes for such artists like Alle Farben, Thomas Lizzara, Magillian, Ill-Boy Phil & Mehrklang, Roman Jones & Hendrik Zoe just to name a few. Since 2014 they`re running their new imprint ""Perlekind Records"" which claims most of their time.

Hi people, I'm ENiGMA Dubz and I produce/compose a variety of bass driven music. 

I'm an open minded guy who has a passion for bass, and although I want to keep my fans happy, please be aware that I like to keep a variety of vibes going through my tracks, so my uploads can vary in mood and style often. 

However, one thing that will be always be present is plenty of bass and bottom end warmth :)

I have also recently set up another alias for more experimental music and soundscapes/soundtrack music, check it out if your open minded and fancy escaping for a bit:

Thanks for checking my page out anyway and I just want to say a massive thank you to all the labels, channels, blogs and general listeners who have supported and enjoyed my music, I'm very lucky to have a sick fan base!

Big Up,

ENiGMA Dubz

SOKOOL // Heinz Music, OFF Recordings, Poesie Musik, Katermukke

The symbiosis of Mathias and Thomas makes for vibrant sound since 2011, comparable to a congenial intoxication mixed with real, tangible love for electronic music. Long lasting experience behind the decks and in the studio combine fluently to the incomparable “Sokool“ blend. Since their release “Little Bird“ N° 24 on Katermukke, “Sokool“ is playing themselves into the minds and hearts of electronic music and endless partying aficionados far beyond the borders of Berlin. 

By now, they are being booked internationally, for example Vienna, Paris or even Georgia. No wonder, because “Sokool“ is a save bet when it comes to fascinating and unconventional DJ-Sets. Earlier music projects, different genres and colourful life itself are the inspirations for these two masters of their craft. This is exactly the kind of honest-to-the-bone lightheartedness reflected by their original tracks and DJ-Sets. To call “Just play it!“ a mere slogan isn‘t even coming close to the truth. To them, it‘s a way of life! And this is how all those terrific live gigs became a true journey, mesmerizing and great, taking you across Disco, Techno, House and Trance.

Gleich einer Symbiose aus sympathischem Rauschzustand und spürbarer Liebe zur elektronischen Musik gleicht die seit 2011 pulsierende Verbindung zwischen Mathias und Thomas. Jahrelange Erfahrung hinter den Decks und im Studio fließen bei den zwei Berliner Herren geschmeidig ineinander und lassen die unverwechselbare Melange „Sokool“ entstehen. Seit ihrem Release „little bird“ No 24 auf Katermukke spielen sich „Sokool“ weit über die Grenzen Berlins hinaus in die Herzen und Köpfe der Liebhaber elektronischer Klänge und nicht enden wollender Nächte.

Mittlerweile international gebucht, wie in in Wien, Paris oder auch Georgien, faszinieren „Sokool“ mit unkonventionellen Sets. Inspiration finden die Zwei sowohl in eigenen früheren musikalischen Projekten unterschiedlicher musikalischer Genres als auch im bunten Leben selbst. Diese ehrliche Unbeschwertheit spiegelt sich auch in ihren Produktionen und Sets wieder.  „Sokool“ hat ein Motto, wenn nicht sogar Lebenseinstellung: „Spiels einfach!!!“ Dadurch entstehen live, auf jedem Gig, neue und erlebbare Geschichten und schillernde Reisen zwischen Disco, Techno, House und Trance.

A quick look through the shelves of J&AG's studio reveals a 15 year obsession with electronic music; from King Street, Locked On, Force Inc and Roule to Robsoul, Kompakt, 20:20 and City Rockers - it's a nostalgic documentation of their transition from bedroom DJ's to two of the scene's most dedicated players. 

Their Moda Black record label has become one of the most acclaimed imprints to emerge in recent years, gaining worldwide notoriety for releasing high quality, forward-thinking electronic music. With a strong focus on emerging artists and alternative sounds, the label's back-catalogue spans from futurist talents such as Theo Kottis, Walker & Royce and Hauswerks, though to globally established powerhouses like Hot Since 82, Danny Daze and Groove Armada. 

As producers J&AG have developed a diverse fan base, releasing on labels such as Pets, Get Physical, Kling Klong and, of course, Moda Black. Their texture heavy productions harness a unique and dynamic sound, that has garnered support from a wide range of artists including Soul Clap, M.A.N.D.Y, Eats Everything, Pete Tong and many more. 

Their obsessive approach to finding new music has lead to numerous radio appearances, from their much praised Essential Mix in May 2013 to taking-over Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 show on numerous occasions. 

2015 is set to be their biggest yet, with the launch of their latest concept Lost Village - a 5000 person boutique festival set in an abandoned woodland village in the Lincolnshire countryside, featuring artists such as DJ Koze, Four Tet, John Talabot, Jackmaster and lots more. 

This year will also see the boys release more new music than ever before, as well as curating the 4th annual Moda Black album, the second instalment of Little Black Book, a collaboration project with Sidney Charles and pan-European Moda Black parties.

ABOUT:
___________________________________________________
Schau nie zurück, sondern lebe mit der Musik!

Genauso spiegelt sich das Leben des im Jahre 1991 geborenen Michel Krause wider. Ein kesser, sympathischer Typ – geboren und zu Hause in der Kleinstadt Leisnig bei Leipzig.
Das Interesse für die elektronische Musik entdeckte er bereits in seinen jungen Jahren bei einer Gartenfete mit Freunden. Dieses Genre war für Ihn völlig neu und somit begann die Mission für sein Lebenswerk.
Mit dem Wunsch „einzigartig zu sein“ und „sich von der Masse abzuheben“, startete der damals 18 jährige sein musikalisches Projekt mit dem Namen „AIRDICE“.
Erste Erfolge wie gewonnene Contest ́s und erfolgreiche Produktionen ließen die Kontakte stets wachsen und somit auch die Line-Up ́s füllen.
Bis heute kann er mit seiner Musik – bestehend aus treibenden Beats und schönen Melodien sowie „CHILL&ABGEH“-Tracks – all seine Sets erfolgreich unter die tanzende Meute bringen.
Seine größten Erfolge sind u.a. mit den beiden Hits „TU BIE“ sowie dem „FIRST LOVE REMIX“ von „Filou“ zu verzeichnen. Dazu kommen zahlreiche bekannte Festivals wie das Sputnik Springbreak, Helene Beach & Sonne Mond Sterne-Festival. Nicht zu vergessen, seine Auftritte in der Schweiz.
„Man darf nie vergessen, wem man alles etwas zu verdanken hat, denn nichts kommt von allein und fällt vom Himmel!“ Dies ist ein weiteres Zitat des Künstlers, womit er großen Dank an seine Fans / Freunde / Kollegen / Veranstalter und seiner aktuellen Bookingagentur „Globalstage“ ausspricht.
Wir können also noch auf vieles in der Zukunft gespannt sein!",11413,26,https://www.facebook.com/airdice,https://www.facebook.com/airdice,,,"http://globalstage.eu/index.php/component/zoo/item/airdice?Itemid=103

http://monarchmastering.com/order

(All payments are made through Paypal)

2) Once payment is confirmed you will be automatically redirected to an upload form where you 

can upload your tracks in Wav. Format, and without limiters on the final master bus.

We just need the final master mix individual track (not each individual instrument 

track/stems)

3) We will master your songs ensuring that each one reaches its optimal potential. Our 

mastering process guarantees that your tracks can be up to par with modern tracks not in only 

in volume/thickness but in crystal clear clarity as well.

We also fix any phase issues to ensure your tracks playback consistency on every type of 

speaker whether it be an iPod, Car or a Club System.

The mastering process is necessary to release your tracks on Beatport, Itunes etc. or play 

your tracks in a live venue. Many labels also require your tracks to be mastered just to even 

be considered for release/demo submissions.

4) We will email you a secure, private download link from our personal Mediafire Server that 

will contain 2 versions of each song that you send to us (1 with commercial loudness and 1 

with more dynamic range) in Wav. format, 24 bit quality.

5) You are guaranteed to receive your tracks within 48 hours of your upload.

Ever since he was a child the acoustic world was always the centre of San Miguels universe. Grown up in East Berlin he was diving deeper and deeper into the sound of the multifarious city of tunes. Music turned into his clear passion. The sound is contemporary, deep and emotional. In all of his productions you can hear the extatic diversity combined with a fresh tune. In 2008 San Miguel established the Berlin record label „Phonothek Records“. As an creative and outgoing guy he wanted to share his passion in many ways, so he founded „Einfach Liebe“ which is a community of various artists and a pool for a variety of events. All in the mission of love. ♥

Herr Vogel heisst Vogel, Daniel Vogel. Klingt sehr zentraleuropäisch, aber Herr Vogel ist geborener US-Amerikaner, wobei er nie wirklich jenseits des Atlantiks gelebt hat. Sein kosmopolites Ich spielt sich denn auch hauptsächlich im kreativen Teil seines Kopfes ab: Innert kürzester Zeit vermochte sich der Sympathieträger mit den vielen Tattoos einen Namen in der internationalen House-Szene zu verschaffen, nicht zuletzt dank herausragender Remixes und Edits, die es ohne Umwege und Verzögerung in die Plattenkoffer namhafter Berufskollegen geschafft haben.

Dennoch sieht sich Herr Vogel, was seine Leidenschaften betrifft, derzeit mehr als DJ denn als Produzent: „Ich liebe es lange Sets zu spielen, deepe und vorwärtstreibende Dinger, welche die Meute zwischen den Boxen in euphorischer Bewegung halten“. Von einigen clubbenden Zeitgenossen wird Herr Vogel dem aktuellen Deep House-Hype zugerechnet, wobei er selbst dieser Welle nicht allzu viel abgewinnen kann: „Ich gehe meinen eigenen Weg und mich interessiert eigentlich nicht gross, was gerade ‚hip‘ oder ‚angesagt‘ sein soll. Generell kann ich künstlichen Hypes nicht allzu viel abgewinnen und versuche viel mehr, Zeitloses mit meinem unverwechselbaren Fingerabdruck zu generieren – das ist es, was mich interessiert“.

Jeder, der bereits das Vergnügen hatte Herr Vogel während der Ausübung seiner Tätigkeit zu beobachten, kann nachvollziehen was er damit meint: Hier ist einer am Werk, der nur Dinge tut, hinter denen er zu 100% stehen kann – das A und auch das O für jeden Künstlers, der sich mit seiner Kunst identifizieren will und auch die Grundvoraussetzung für eine schnell ansteigende und anhaltende Karriere, die Herr Vogel ohne jeden Zweifel zusteht und die er sich auch holen wird.",28166,41,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Herr-Vogel/354679121211702,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Herr-Vogel/354679121211702,,http://www.youtube.com/user/HerrVogelMusic,"http://www.les-garcons.ch/artists/herr-vogel/

laurajones,Chill/Mainstream,Laura Jones,http://soundcloud.com/laurajones,David@airlondonmusic.com,"Amidst an endless army of DJs, Laura Jones´ light shines bright through the underground. On first glance perhaps it´s her trademark orange sunglasses and presence that can beam a smile from behind a turntable to the other side of a festival. Or the fact that her first forays into production steam rollered her into the spotlight. The house and techno starlet strode into our lives in 2011 with Love In Me, a summer anthem that filled her diary for the year almost overnight. But Laura´s story didn´t just begin with a big track and an eye condition that requires her to wear the glasses that protect her vision. It began at an early age spending every penny collecting music. Buying vinyl like her life depended on it after discovering underground music on an Ibizan dancefloor. Bucking the trend of one hit wonder producers lacking the DJing skills to maintain their success on the world stage, she´s earning a reputation as one of the world's favourite touring DJs.

Mat.Joe. Matze and Johannes, two young men with a Hip Hop and House affection conquering Berlin.
Their productions come to life in a Neukölln backyard where studio equipment and DJ decks meet desiccated plants. A natural development when music has become the top priority from dusk till dawn.
Back in 2006, Rap, Breakdance and Skateboarding were the passions that made them best buddies and this deep connection is reflected in their music, again and again. In 2008, they formed the producer team Twomanics and concentrated on authentic and credible hip hop productions for independent artists. Originally from Hannover, they moved to Berlin for new artistic challenges and after MySpace, mixtapes and candy, Mat.Joe have found their own style: crispy Housebeats paired with rhythmic Soul and Hip Hop elements. The result is deep and dancefloor-qualified, warm and rough.
Inspiration is found everywhere between subway rides, late night showers and favorite bars. New ideas are kept manically on every smartphone nearby. This is sound autism at the highest stage. Mat.Joe's love for music and the ambition to improve are the main ingredients that keep the engine running. See you there.",25750,84,http://www.facebook.com/matjoemusic,http://www.facebook.com/matjoemusic,https://twitter.com/matjoemusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/MatJoeMusicTV,"http://www.jackmode-agency.com/

-------------------------------------------

FEW HAVE CHANNELED THEIR LIFE STRUGGLES INTO DEFINITIVE MUSICAL LANDMARKS TO THE EXTENT OF BAGGI; A MAN WHOSE REVERED MELODIC WIZARDRY HAS AFFORDED HIM AN EXTENSIVE GRASP ON GLOBAL CLUB LAND.

Born in 1979, the story of Baggi far exceeds musical manifestation. As a Bosnian native, the Yugoslav Civil War proved an insatiable battleground of social and physical preservation to what should have been his tender teenage years. Through the suffering, imprisonment, loss of loved ones and his eventual release from a detention camp in 1992, his earliest tests and tribulations have served as considerable drivers to the leaps and bounds now associated with his global overhaul. Times have changed. Social landmarks have come and gone. Armed only with the haunting memories of his earlier tribulations, Baggi's club deviance has been modestly tailored, yet wholeheartedly executed to make relevant marks on the modern market.

As an industrious playground, few could argue the positive legwork made by Baggi upon his relocation to Rotterdam. Away from the constant reminders of political unrest, Baggi would staple himself amid the thriving Netherland's circuit, immersing himself among such long serving peers as Funkerman, Hardsoul and Rene Amesz – the latter of whom he would top the progressive house charts alongside for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" With a back catalogue including collaborative duties alongside Erick Morillo, Roger Sanchez and a strong presence on Defected Record's Ibiza 09 compilation, there is no shortage of indicators of Baggi's preserved musical aptitude.

Call it house music, EDM, or assorted Baggi charm, but this is one artist whose ever-expansive studio arsenal knows no limitations but upfront quality. A tropical groove-master by inauguration whose stints for Musical Freedom, Defected Records, Toolroom Records and Spinnin Records alike broke incessant momentum across the industry, modern times are yet to hinder his eclectic get-up. More recently, remixes for Rita Ora, Kelly Clarkson and Rod Stewart have underpinned his unwillingness to shy from the ever-expanding boundaries of popular music; yet another asset that has kept him in consistent visibility amid his craft's undeniable renaissance.

But for the most part, Baggi remains as relevant and club-footed as ever for 2013. Tiësto, a long time provocateur and advocate of Baggi's pursuit of solo stardom, has played a considerable part in this full-circle of musical liberation. Dropping his debut single for Musical Freedom exactly 21-years after losing his father to the atrocities of war, their new found collaborative partnership – as formally celebrated during Tiësto's set at UMF, signals a liberating streak for Baggi and his accomplished studio persona.

Trends have taken wind, but the well-travelled artists buoyancy on the global club circuit remains evident in the sheer scope of his global presence. Between landmark stints at Mysteryland, Global Gathering, Creamfields and Space Ibiza, Baggi's studio output and fluid turntable maneuvers continue to cater for every facet of club land without compromising on the quality that has kept the air miles racking up throughout his whirlwind career.

Baggi's story has not always been one of plain sailing, but through music, the chimes of liberation have offered considerable redemption. Taking 2013 like a man driven only to excel the ranks of his craft, one thing remains painfully evident where the long serving Bosnian talent is concerned: music is an outright liberator when placed in heartfelt hands.",20272,132,https://www.facebook.com/BaggiOfficial,https://www.facebook.com/BaggiOfficial,http://twitter.com/BaggiOfficial,http://www.youtube.com/user/baggibegovic?feature=mhee,"http://www.baggibegovic.com

Leipzig and its musicians – they are quite something. The city’s music history includes Johann Sebastian Bach, Matthias Tanzmann and Thomas Brachmann. However, Brachmann is probably rather known under his acronym TOM B. Although TOM B. reads “tomb”, “grave” in the English language, in the context of music, it stands for his DJ sets and productions fully enjoying live. 
People say that Leipzig is the new Berlin, especially when it comes to clubbing and music. Paul Kalkbrenner was born here, however, he moved to the capital, later. What used to be dark and sooty due to the established industry and coal mining is now surrounded by newly created see landscapes, thriving with new life. Leipzig has come to be known as “Hypzig”. TOM B., born in 1984 on the southern outskirts of the trade-fair city, has experienced that amazing change first-hand, has even given it is own face. He started to perform as a DJ in 1999. In 2001 he had his first gig in the legendary Distillery club that is Germany’s oldest House & Techno Club.

Up until the year 2005 he was a Distillery resident, he was the first five years of the millennium at home, here. Since 2009 the Skyclub is his home base, unless he has gigs in Amsterdam, Budapest, Berlin, Hamburg or Munich. Additionally, TOM B. has been a member of Dusted Decks right of its outset, which counts 9 years by now. His sound is characterized by House, Deephouse and Tech House. Remixes for David K. and Nicolas Hannig, M-22 and Anton Ishutin are what he is known for.

TOM B. will take part in the “About:Berlin” Compilation by Universal Music and present “Drive without Engine”. His productions are released on Damm und Klang Gymnastik, Fukai, Music/Great Stuff and Well Done! together with remixes by Lexer, Teenage Mutants and Rich vom Dorf or by
Ron Flatter, Nico Pusch and Thomas Lizzara.

Even if the year 1984 – which marks the birth of TOM B. – predicts a rather dark vision in the eyes of George Orwell in 1949 – we have to say that looking back at 1984 now, in 2015, that year must have been an excellent one! Music by and from Leipzig is en vogue – and we rightly owe that to Tom B., too!

MADMIKEY,Chill/Mainstream,Official MadMikey,http://soundcloud.com/officialmadmikey,madmikeybookings@hotmail.com,"MadMikey was born on the 7th of February 1986 in Amsterdam and grew up with all kinds of music genres. He always had a great love for music, and always thought about producing his own tracks. Eventually that happened: He started at the age of 16 with producing music, experimenting with sounds and bpm's. Throughout the years he produced a variety of genres, but mainly Hip-Hop and Grime. In April 2011 everything changed, he started making a style that was based on Dubstep with all kinds of other EDM influences in it. He had already known it for a while and listened to it, but it took some time before the spark spread over to him. Today he is a rising Dubstep DJ/Producer with an increasing number of overwhelming, hard dropping tracks.

Regoton,Chill/Mainstream,Kevin Rego,http://soundcloud.com/regoton,phil@bashrecords.com,"Kevin Rego, the body behind the moving machine of Regoton, has been tinkering in the basement for years learning the ins and outs of his craft. Along the way, he’s remixed tracks by Steve Aoki, Nervo, Zedd, and other top-flight acts in the progressive house genre. Although it may seem like “just another house DJ” remixing these tracks, his work is far superior than the work of his peers; his tracks have been supported by some of the biggest acts in the world, including Afrojack, W&W, Steve Aoki, 3LAU, & Paris & Simo, just to name a few. The last few months have seen an increase in productions from Regoton: he’s put out multiple original tracks, such as his track “Bobble,” his collaboration with Culture Code Ft. Jonny Rose on “Waking Up,” and his most recent banger with Loudan titled “Zen”, which was released on Cr2 Records, and charted all the way up to #51 on the Beatport Progressive House Top 100.

Regoton’s methodical approach to music comes from the heart. As the electronic scene becomes more and more saturated with uninspired big room drops and tasteless bass kicks, he focuses more on the melodic side of progressive. Instead of splitting the dance floor with typical bass drops, Regoton lifts the spirits of his listeners with soaring, melodic choruses and finely tuned electro inserts. Seriously, it’s difficult to listen to a track touched by Regoton and not shuffle across the room. His formula is pretty simple: “I gotta enjoy what I’m doing. I enjoy the music that I make, so during my sets I play what sounds like it. I want my crowds to keep moving, to keep dancing. I want them to feel energetic and alive. I want to know that my energy is being received.”

Regoton doesn’t plan on staying put. Although he’s been building a name for himself in Montreal, the next year proves to be monumental in his global image. Expect to see Regoton showing up in clubs near you, sending beautiful, uplifting progressive house tunes through the speakers and into your hearts. Prepare yourself for an emotional experience; Regoton lives by one mantra: “Music is about expression…and nothing else, really.”

Known for breeding some of the worlds most intriguing yet electrifying dance music artists on the planet, Melbourne has once again endured the bangin’ entrance of an electro house and bounce candidate. Initiating the electronic scene like a true player, Trifo hits the booth with a vengeance, and the studio with claws.

Playing on bills shared with Avicii, Hardwell, Steve Aoki and his musical inspiration Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, the Trifo brand has shone a spark on the Australian dance scene from warming up for TIESTO’s only club show @ Marquee Sydney to holding a 2015 residency at the world famous brand. 

Trifo’s production has impressed internationally and locally with support from David Guetta and Blasterjaxx, signing to Laidback Luke’s Mixmash imprint after impressing the man himself and his latest single ‘Rule The World’ released on Club Cartel followed with an official remix by Sydney sider J-Trick its safe to say Trifo is here to stay.

It’s fair to say that the Futuristic Polar Bears have had a phenomenal few years. Through their own relentless hard work and outstanding capabilities both in the production studio and behind the decks, the trio have been on an incredible ride and achieved the seemingly unachievable. 

With a combined skill set of accomplished DJs, producers and musicians, Luke, Rhys and Fran have become global favourites, having destroyed dancefloors in far flung destinations such as North America, India, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, China, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Holland, Italy, Kazakhstan and Ibiza with their indisputable energy and dynamic DJ sets. It’s these sets that have earned them shows at the biggest and best venues, including four of the top 10 clubs in the world; Octagon (Seoul), Zouk Singapore, BCM (Mallorca) and UshuaÏa (Ibiza), as well Ministry of Sound, Marquee and Zouk KL also in the top 50.
	
Recognised for their effervescent progressive house sounds, in the last 18 months alone they’ve had releases on Revealed Recordings, Spinnin’ Records, Wall Recordings, Smash The House, Armada and Harem and gained consistent chart success with each and every release. Back To Earth became their first Beatport #1 in 2014, followed by a further 10 top 20s and a #25 US Billboard smash with Thundergod. It’s not surprising they were placed #40 in Beatport’s ‘Best of 2015 – Progressive House Artist’. 

They’ve been championed by the likes of KSHMR, Tiësto, Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike, Dyro, R3hab, Sander van Doorn, Firebeatz, Sick Individuals and most notably Hardwell. With several releases on his imprint under their belt, the Futuristic Polar Bears’ continuing relationship as part of the Revealed Recordings family saw them play the label’s stage at Creamfields 2014, taking over the decks from Hardwell himself following his set. An arsenal of unmissable collaborations with Danny Howard, Sultan + Shepard, Thomas Newson and Sandro Silva and with plenty more in the pipeline cement the Polar Bears as one of the most exciting production outfits in the industry right now. 

The trio’s thirst for music doesn’t stop there – their cutting-edge Global Radio Show dominates the digital airwaves, going out to over a million listeners in 42 countries across the world every single week. 

With a packed release schedule and a tour diary crammed with worldwide club and festival dates, there’ll definitely be no state of hibernation anytime soon for these Bears…

Music is a natural state of mind to Frenchman Cédric Lass. Ever indulged by the way sound influences and shapes people, his incentive in life is to move the crowd with his own treat of the trade. With more than 15 years of DJ experience, a master in Music Technology and several international residencies, it’s not hard to envision a promising future ahead.Next to reaching out to the electronic dance scene through his monthly ‘From Space With Love’ podcast, pushing over 300,000 downloads, his career has taken him from places all across Europe, Asia and Russia to USA and South America. Having signed tracks to High Times, Hungry Koala, Poprox Muzik, Vulver Records, BANG IT! , Make Some Noise Music, House Session Records, ENSIS Records, CloudNine Recordings, ... his originals have gained support by the likes of R3hab, Sick Individuals, Fedde le Grand, Showtek, Justin Prime, Claude VonStroke, Joachim Garraud and many more … 
‘Party Hard’ reached Top 10 in Beatport’s Minimal chart and Top 20 in the Electro House Chart, ‘Faith’ reached Top 4 in the Future House Pulse Chart, while ‘No Way!’ instantly hit the French Club Top 40 and became one of the most played club track in 2014’s winter months. Open-minded behind the decks as well as in the studio, you’ll find it no surprise that his originals cover all things house music. A Lass record is hard to pigeonhole, but perfectly balances electro, progressive and future house. With a unstoppable drive to create, share and live music, big things are ahead for this French producer, DJ and rising star. You’re advised to keep an eye out for Cedric Lass.A perfectionist in all ways and means, this guy only just got started.

Setting fire to dancefloors with chopped breaks, deadly deep subs, soundclash mentality and pure euphoria. 

FFF started ""djing"" on 2 turntables (without pitch control) early 90s. Mixing mainly rave, techno and the sparse UK breakbeat hardcore imports that arrived at his local record shops. 
First steps into making music: combining sounds from vinyl mixed with tapeloops, sounds from his sisters keyboard and a lot of feedback. Things changed big time when his parents bought a PC and his friends turned him onto tracker software. 

Mid 90s he started the cassette label ""Orange Socks"" on which he released his own material plus music from his friends and artists he met through tapetrading. He released his first track on vinyl in 2001 (on the French Necromaniacs Industry label) and from then on kept releasing on  a wide range of labels (Planet Mu, Kool.Pop, Murder Channel, Prspct RVLT, Hong Kong Violence, Mindbender, Sozialistischer Plattenbau, Sprengstoff, Clash, K-produktions, Sonic Beligeranza, Ketacore, Encounters, Artcore, Dub Attack, Zero71) His first full length album ""20.000 Hardcore Members Can't Be Wrong"" was released on the Japanese Murder Channel Label in 2011. And the follow up ""Keep The Fire"" in 2013.

In 2001 Bong-Ra & FFF organized the Breakcore a GoGo parties. These became one of the first regular Breakcore nights in Europe. When BCGG ended in 2004, FFF continued to promote breakcore & Jungle on the monthly Wreck havoc nights which never officially stopped and still pop up once in a while. 

FFF is an obsessive vinyl collector. A trip to the record shop, flea market, thrift stores, record fair and the element of surprise that comes with crate digging are most of the times the basic inspiration for a new track. 

Live you can expect amen warfare, hoovers, rave horns and tropical vibes with elements of jungle, rave, bubbling, dancehall and gabber. 


""Every single track will have audiences calling “Tuune!” and demanding a wheel!!"" - Kid Kameleon

Spending his formative years on a farm outside of Canberra, he was first shown Dance Music by his sisters, and he hasn’t looked back since. Having played trombone in a world touring band and been trained in Classical Piano, his roots in music are well founded. His sets and productions are acclaimed high energy and filled with party tunes when playing at well renowned Sydney Venues like Candy’s Nightclub, The Loft and The Glasshouse, as well as a packed out Beer Hall tent at Oktoberfest in the Domain. Accumulating 10s of thousands of views on streaming media, supported by Emoh Instead, Generik, Ember, Blasterjaxx and Tom Budin, this country boy is here to take Australia by storm.

NeonKnightsOfficial,Chill/Mainstream,Neon Knights,http://soundcloud.com/neonknightsofficial,stephan@tonedeafmanagement.com,"Sean Listro and Kane Gasparotto are a powerhouse duo from Toronto, Ontario. They are the Neon Knights and are taking their instruments and music to a whole new level in the live electronic music scene. 

Both Sean and Kane come from a heavily musical influenced background. Sean has been trained in both classical guitar and electric guitar since the age of 10, and continues to excel his skill on guitar everyday. Kane attended St. Michaels Choir School, world renowned as one of the best all male choirs in the world, for most of his life. Kane gained his musical talents from this school and quickly picked up playing the drums. Over the past few years Kane has drummed alongside the likes of Steve Aoki and Zeds Dead. With Sean, as Neon Knights, they have shared the stage with artists such as Felix Cartel, Andy’s iLL and the Sour DJs to name a few. Kane has dedicated himself to playing drums as Sean has with guitar, and in 2010 the two met and began what would soon become Neon Knights. 

Neon Knights took Kane and Sean’s musical talents and applied it to the current electronic dance music scene. They have transferred their musical talents over to DJing and incorporate their instruments into their live show. Neon Knights specialize in spinning/performing Electro House/ Progressive House & Dubstep. 

Neon Knights sound can be summed up in a few words: aggressive, heavy riffed, heavy hitting, ‘in your face’ music. They thrive off the energy at every show and transfer that into all of their music leaving people wanting more.

Vamos Art – That is Lars Giereth and Andi Zielbauer from Stuttgart

Both have been engaged as residents in the Decadencia Event Series where they have already shared the stage with well-known names of the scene.

While Lars has been turning the black gold since 2005, Andi got on board in 2009 with productions and live sets. Their musical background also shows further parallels – both were active as drummers in their youth for many years. Rhythm and beat have always been a part of their life.

In the middle of 2012 they finally came together and then of course what happened was: Vamos Art was born!

The Tech-house sound of Vamos Art is mainly characterized by soulful sounds and playful breaks that cause shivers on the dance floor. Melodious sound carpets are part of their musical repertoire as well as the driving bass lines.

We are looking forward to their upcoming productions in the near future!

There must be something devastatingly contagious in the French air at the 

moment. Normally home of the worlds best beat-driven Electro and Filter-House 

acts, the country of fromage and baguettes has a fresh new musical breeze up 

their already long sound tunnel. Several excitingly fresh talents are emerging 

out of nowhere and are responsible for some of the smoothest Deep House vibes 

south of the border. Wad AD is one of those fast rising French stars, which are 

clearly redefining their home countries typical approach to club music. Instead of 

using tons of filter and distortion effects, young producers such as Camille Meyer 

prefer warm, soulful and natural sounds. 

Notes, instruments and composing have always been an integral part of this 

mans life. At age 6 he already learned how to play the violin. By the age of 

13 Wad Ad fell in love with electronic music by listening to fantastic acts 

such as Miss Kittin, Ivan Smagghe, Justice and many more. A few years after 

discovering the beat that will never stop, this French DJ started experimenting 

with turntables and Ableton Live. His passion for Deep House tunes might have 

commenced quite late at age 21, but within a short time span Camille has clearly 

mastered and understood this beautiful subgenre. The subtle maturity und clear 

vision of his first tracks is astounding. One would think that this newcomer has 

been playing the club circuit for many years and uses his vast experience for 

sculpturing his fine tunes. But Camille has achieved all this within a few short 

years. 

Answers, Changes featuring Faul and Astroluv are the first three tracks released 

by this musical protégée. All three productions have a clear identity to them, 

which could be labeled as the Wad Ad sound.

Where this young man will take us in the future waits to be seen. One thing is for 

sure, it will be a comfortable and smooth ride form start to finish.",7634,3,http://www.facebook.com/Wadadz,http://www.facebook.com/Wadadz,,,,2,harald@mfm-booking.deContact.wadad@gmail.com

The Born in Luebeck , but Berliner by choice , Wolfgang Lohr , is a true musician at heart. For 15 years he worked tirelessly as a trumpeter, singer and songwriter for the German ska band ""DaSKArtell"" . He gave concerts, played at festivals and also made a name for himself in the studio. Wolfgang discovered his love of electronic music late - but intensively. Two and a half years ago, after a period of rummaging through clubs and feeling revitalized by his experiences, the Berliner by choice started to experiment with the Tech House genre. Once excited, there was no stopping the man, the self-taught musician made the decision to lock himself in his four walls, until he had honed his craft. Meanwhile Wolfgand has produced 13 EPs and numerous remixes for labels such as "" Ton liebt Klang "", ""Ostfunk"", ""Acker Records"", ""Zuckerton"" and ""Symbiostic"" . The man, who is a fan of humorous puns recently celebrated his first chart entry and is currently working on his first own album.

Whether ""Affenstillstand  Evolution"", ""Hirnholzraspel"" or "" Duft & Triebe "" – He represents a diverse range of music  that is arranged rich in detail and feels equally at home in the Tech House, Deep House, House, Minimal and Electro Swing genres. The all rounder has worked tirelessly to create his own personal style. His “Lohr worms” as he calls them, are especially impulsive and bass line-oriented. ""My music should bring euphoria to the dance floor, pump the club , at home stimulate appetite and above all be fun,"" said the newcomer.

But producing alone is not enough for him : Since 2012 he has been mixing it up in the club scene as a live act. With his sets not being pre-arranged, he directly addresses his audiences wants and needs,  so each piece is unique.
Long story short : Wolfgang is an experience, a refreshing Hanseatic bringing universal music to the Spree.

Bio: The best proof of love is trust – that counts for the lovely partnership in life as well as for creative arts. Whether in your own talents or in the well-meaning fate: trust mostly paves the cheerful way to happiness. The Berlin based electronic duo AKA AKA are the best example that trust in your own personal work does not only disburse, but is also spelled with elements of courage, faith and strength of purpose.
When Saarland-born Hannes and Holger from East Frisia met each other at a Berlin open-air party in 2008, it wasn’t only the start of a refreshing friendship; they found the infamous wavelength in very short period of time. With different socialization equipped, they both use their divergent past as well as the joint project AKA AKA to give their common ambition a name. With Oliver Koletzki’s label Stil vor Talent they found their first home in 2009. With its catchy grooves and minimal aesthetics, their debut EP ""Vögeln"" did not only reflect the spirit of that time, but was supported by the likes of Richie Hawtin and Troy Pierce.
The track „Woody Woodpecker“ with his didgeridoo intermezzo and deep bass was featured as the third best track in the category minimal of 2010’s Beatport Music Awards. Spurred by the growing number of experiences as a live act and slightly before releasing more material on Stil vor Talent, the two set up their own imprint Burlesque Musique in 2009. Starting with the passion of freethinking and moving electronic sounds ranging from swing, Balkan-influenced house and funk, the current techno-driven orientation including pathetic melodies reflects AKA AKA’s bandwidth. The label is not only the way out of the release madness of the industry, but an inspiring stage for young talents and new faces. Besides formidable EPs of Umami, Niconé and Budzillus, with their „Springtide EP“ AKA AKA & Thalstroem made their first appearance on Burlesque Musique in 2011.
Hannes and Holger were immediately fascinated by the gentle skills of trumpeter Thalstroem as they first met him in a vodka bar in Berlin. In March 2010 they played at Berlin's Watergate for the first time as a trio – and the experiment should not remain an experiment. Together with Thalstroem, AKA AKA worked on their joint debut album ""Varieté"". Published in May 2011 on Burlesque Musique, the record was not only honored by the readers of the prestigious Groove magazine among the top albums in 2011, the reader poll of the Partysan magazone awarded AKA AKA & Thalstroem as ""Best Live Act 2011"" and the second best newcomer. With its mid- tempo house drive and deep minimalism, the record represents their final catalyst. Especially in combination with Thalstroem and his ""Electronic Wind Instrument"" they put a final touch to their unusual, fresh and dreamy trademark sound, which provides live even more endorphin boosts. Whether heard in Berlin clubs like Watergate, Ritter Butzke, Tresor, Magdalena as well as Arena Club or during their international gigs in Amsterdam, Madrid, Moscow, Oslo, Turin or Vienna – AKA AKA & Thalstroem are kings of entertainment. Always open, always engaging, always fun.
After several remixes for Oliver Schories, Turntablerocker and Thomas Schumacher, in May 2012 the trio introduced a veritable Who's Who of the scene for „Varieté Remixed“ in order to present new interpretations of tracks from their debut. Besides Tigerskin, Moonbootica and Lexy & K-Paul other big names like Dapayk, Marek Hemmann and Phonique rearranged standout tracks like ""French toast"", ""What Matters"" or ""Afterglow"". In the same year the first and foremost live act AKA AKA &
Thalstroem went on a great tour, not missing festival as Timewarp, Sea of Love, Sun, Moon, Stars, Mayday, Nature One and Super Rave. In addition to new releases and parties of their label Burlesque Musique, the trio is planning a new, second album for 2014. That's right, the journey of AKA AKA & Thalstroem is far from over, because who stops wanting to be better, ceases to be good.",88488,314,http://www.facebook.com/akaberlin,http://www.facebook.com/akaberlin,,http://www.youtube.com/user/AKAAKAlive,"http://www.akaaka.de

- Zenon/Kinematic
The Ryanosaurus sound is a monstrous mix of phat baselines, glitchy soundscapes, emotive melody and a sly playfulness. It walks the line between progressive and full on psychedelic trance, with frequent forays into foreign styles and influences.

The project begun as a place to release the solo work of Ryan from Australia. With a drive for interesting but crisp and powerful production, the psychedelic trance genre was an instant attraction. After years of cutting his teeth on the local Sydney scene and writing with Mr Bill for his duo project Electrocado, Ryan begun releasing Ryanosaurus on well known free music distributor Ektoplazm and quickly built up a following for his unique style.

He has now had releases on Zenon Records, Kinematic, Iboga, HOMmega, Another Psyde, Maia, Glitchy Tonic, UP Records, Hass Records and has a host of upcoming releases across various other labels.

Description:
___________
""...simultaneously aqueous and intergalactic, full of gooey synth lines, syncopated rhythms, and fuzzy, dubby sounds...  so many textures melding and warping together, giving the listener a reason to pay attention.""
(Molly Beauchemin - Pitchfork)

""Incredibly strange & wonderful... Stunning... Absolutely phenomenal...""
(Mary Anne Hobbs - Radio 1 / Xfm)

""A producer that we think is destined for big things...""
(Goldierocks - NME Radio / Radio 1 / 4Music)

""...collage-like, sounding a little like the production work of Sampha or Frank Ocean's early sketches.""
(Dummy Mag)

""...gruff and sweet, heavy and dreamy, spiky and soft-focus...""
(FACT Magazine - The 100 Best Tracks of 2012)

""...pure professionalism, delighting in the slickness of its own textures...""

Abril de 2013 deu-se inicio ao um novo projeto chamado Dogreen, idealizado por Rodolfo Mariano. Em meados de 2009 começou sua carreira como DJ Set, onde conviveu com diversos gêneros musicais até encontrar seu foco e dar inicio em suas produções. 
Apesar de seu grande nome no Gangsta House, Dogreen mantêm a essencia do House, no qual vem trabalhando com variações de Sub  e vocais marcantes.
Embora ser um projeto novo, Dogreen vem recebendo suportes de grandes nomes da cena como Amine Edge & Dance (FR), Shiba San (FR), Legitimate Scandal (UK), André Marques (BR), Velkro (BR), Grant Nelson (UK), Sirus Hood (FR), Kyle Watson (SA).
Em 2014 alcançou o Top 1 de vendas do DJTUNES com seu hit ""Girl You Gotta Show Me"" através do selo Gamerness Music (ES). E também TOP 6 do Beatport com o VA Various Artists da Zero Eleven (BR).
Teve a oportunidade de se apresentar em grandes clubes e festas como Pacha Ibiza Tour, Sunday Sessions, Park Art, entre outros grandes eventos.

Sergio Trillini - Breeze (Original Mix)

BIOGRAPHY English
Sergio Trillini was born in Zurich. The young DJ and producer discovered early his passion for electronic music. Although the sector of Dance fascinated him initially, with time it became more and more the impulsive Techno Beats that grabbed his attention. It didn't take long for him to be fully immersed with this genre. Bookings at the most established techno clubs in Switzerland followed and so the young DJ with Italian background was firmly established in the scene. Today you would define his music as more impulsive and innovative Techno with influence of Minimal. This can be heard in his own productions as well. In 2011 Sergio Trillini released his first track called ""Blast Pipe"" on Ahmet Sendil's label ""Bosphorus Underground Recording"". Following were two EPs in 2012 that landed on Spartaque’s label ""I AM TECHNO"" with remixes by well-known artists like Alex di Stefano or Mark Denken. The Tracks were played and supported by the Technoelite. 2012 provided a lot of fantastic moments for him and this is just the beginning. 


BIOGRAFIE Deutsch
Sergio Trillini erblickte in Zürich das Licht der Welt. Der junge DJ und Produzent entdeckte bereits früh die Leidenschaft für die elektronische Musik. Obwohl es damals eher noch der Dance Bereich war, welcher ihn begeisterte, so faszinierten ihn mit der Zeit fortwährend mehr die treibenden Tech-Beats. Es dauerte auch nicht lange bis er sich gänzlich diesem Genre widmete und das mit Erfolg. Es folgten Bookings in den angesagtesten Clubs der Schweiz, und schnell etablierte sich der junge Zürcher mit italienischen Wurzeln in der Szene. Seine Musik heute würde man als treibend sowie innovativ mit elektronischen Einflüssen definieren. Dies zeigt sich auch auf seinen Eigenproduktionen. 2011 veröffentlichte Sergio Trillini seinen ersten Track namens Blast Pipe direkt auf Ahmet Sendil’s Label “Bosphorus Underground Recording“. Darauf folgten 2012 zwei EP welche mitsamt Remix von bekannten Künstlern wie Alex di Stefano oder Mark Denken auf Spartaque’s Label „I AM TECHNO“ landeten. 2014 Remixte Sergio Trillini progressive Legende Daniel Portman. Sein Remix landete wochenlang in den Top 18 Beatport Charts und war einer der hundert Bestverkauften Lieder 2014 im Genre Minimal. Seine Lieder werden von den Namhaftesten Künstler der elektronischen Musik gespielt.

BIO:
High energy, hard hitting, Big Room , in your face music is the only way to describe the sound of L.I.A.M.. Formerly known as DJ Nesto, L.I.A.M. interest in electronic music began to take form in 1998 when a close friend shared some Paul Oakenfold with him. By 2002, he had fallen deep into the Houston dance and club scene, exploring House and Trance styles. L.I.A.M.'s dance skills gained him recognition after a few short years, and his attention soon shifted to the DJ and how he could control the crowd just with his tracks selection and mixing skills. He got some gear and began practicing, and it wasn't long before was invited to spin at many top Houston area clubs. In 2006, his interest began to steer more toward Electronic Music, which pushed him further into the scene. He opened for world class artist like Benny Benassi, Tiesto, Donald Glaude, Carl Cox, Goerge Acosta, Markus Shultz, and Paul Oakenfold to name a few. After years of work behind the decks L.I.A.M. began his own music production in 2011 with the goal of pushing his own sound out around the world. With 2012 starting off with music now signed to Donald Glaude's Records, Eden Records, Durty Recording, and DG Records he has started putting his mark on the industry in a big way. L.I.A.M. says ""I never wanted to limit myself to one genre of Electronic Music. Think of listing to Techno, Progressive House, Electro, Moombahton and Dubstep all rolled into one. Such a wide range of sounds and energy gives my sets this kind of unique feel bringing people that love each one together to experience my creativity and love for the music. "" With mesmerizing tones, dark beats, and tantalizing grooves L.I.A.M. sound seem to transport you to a different place. Creating a musical experience like you've never had before.",6842,39,http://www.facebook.com/pages/LIAM/242062919148945?sk=wall,http://www.facebook.com/pages/LIAM/242062919148945?sk=wall,http://twitter.com/#!/LIAM_DJ,,,3,liammuzik@gmail.com

“The drive to make music is more or less my life, it’s like asking someone what inspires them to breathe. Music just is in me somehow and I just need to let it out on the regular. That keeps me sane, regular, and functioning. To me there is a very strong energy and feeling that comes with sharing music or art with people. It’s like the more music that I let out, the more positive energy is able to come in…” - Knight Riderz",12028,20,https://www.facebook.com/KnightRiderzOfficial,https://www.facebook.com/KnightRiderzOfficial,https://twitter.com/KnightRiderz_,,,2,Frank@Autonomousmusic.orgjt@maderogroup.comknightriderzmusic@gmail.com

Crossing borders is a familiar experience to David Mayer. Though being born in south Germany, he spent most of his youth living in Norway and (for a change) in Lanzarote, before Berlin happened to become his home in 2004. As he prefers thinking outside the box, Mayer has always been equally interested in experimenting with diverse forms of music, no matter what musical genre they derive from, although his passion for funked up and heavily pounding 4/4 beats clearly dominates his creative output. Both, when spinning records and producing tracks, he is presenting his own interpretation of catchyness, mixing up Techno and House, adding a little deepness, but always keeping an eye on making his audience shake some.

His dedication finds its way in several musical excursions as a ghost-/coproducer or audio engineer. Only leaving his desk in order to indulge some serious clubbing, you can be sure this guy knows about priorities. As a founding member of the artists collective and label Keinemusik, he is also working on the next thing to tie in with his latest inhouse release...

Heathered Pearls is Polish-born Brooklynite Jakub Alexander, whose career in music was deeply rooted before ever releasing his own. Curator for Tycho’s ISO50 blog, co-founder of the Moodgadget label, and A&R at Ghostly International, Alexander has been entrenched in the industry since 2002. He was first introduced to the power of ambient music by his mother at an early age, discovered techno as a teenager living in the Detroit area, and gradually learned to create his own vision of the genres.

In 2012, Heathered Pearls wrote and released his first album. Loyal mimicked the hypnotic and swelling motions of ocean waves at night with melodic, loop-based ambient music, and was well received across the board. But Alexander would only move on from there, inescapably drawn to dancefloor ideas and memories of the engrossing techno mixes he pored over as a kid. The second Heathered Pearls album, Body Complex, was conceived in that mindset—transforming Loyal's gritty, soporific textures into immaculate 4/4 figurines, glacial tone drifts, and starry synth plateaus. It's the beginning of a new phase in Alexander's ever-evolving project, the possibilities of which expand seamlessly into the realms of music, art, and performance.

Throughout his youth, his father exposed him to a wide variety of Eastern and Western music, giving Menert fertile soil in which to plant his musical visions. His passion for original analog sounds coupled with a vast knowledge of music history has given him an even larger platform from which to produce. A multi-instrumentalist, he incorporates live guitar and keys into his final production for a full sound and rich feel. By tapping into the world of music that surrounds him, Menert twists and turns day-to-day inspirations into music that is all his own. 

Menert worked as the co-producer with Derek Vincent Smith on the chart topping Pretty Lights album Taking Up Your Precious Time, and was a natural choice to be the first artist to join Pretty Lights Music in 2010 with the release of his solo album, Dreaming of a Bigger Life. Michal’s second album with PLM, the critically acclaimed mega-LP Even If It Isn’t Right, dropped in the spring of 2012. Within just a few short months, Menert was landing headlining slots at some of the most prestigious venues in the country. 

His musical collaborations have brought him a wealth of inspiration, and led to the formation of a number of ongoing side projects including Half Color (with Paul Basic), Manic Menert (with Manic Focus), and a slew of others. 2014 saw the culmination of a musical dream with the debut of the Michal Menert Big Band – an 18-piece ensemble led by Michal that performed his catalog in front of thousands, including headlining performances at Denver’s Fillmore Auditorium and direct support at Colorado’s famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre. 

A dynamic and ideological producer, Menert has always taken a community driven approach. He works hand in hand with producers he chooses for his own record label, Super Best Records. By collaborating and working closely with a new generation of hip-hop & EDM producers, he’s bringing a new musical vision to life without any imposed limitations. 

The Spring of 2015 saw the release of Michal’s third LP, Space Jazz on Super Best Records, to an extraordinary response from fans and press. That fall, Menert released the first LP, “1” with his live indie-soul band Michal Menert & the Pretty Fantastics.  His sound combines vintage vinyl samples with rich analog synthesis and organic, hard-hitting beats. It’s a fusion of yesterday’s elements and tomorrow’s ideas. Catch him on tour throughout 2015 and beyond.

Scott Sterling brings a deep love of rhythm, drums, and dance to his distinctive style of bass fusion.  An expert percussionist specializing in the tamborine and framedrum families, he weaves traditional rhythms and melodies into contemporary sounds into finely sculpted grooves, equally inspirational to the dancefloor and the on-stage performer. Drawing inspiration primarily from Celtic and south European modalities, his music combines energetic rhythms with a sensual pagan atmosphere.
 
Originating in San Francisco's crucible of bellydance, bass culture, and world music fusion, Drumspyder has come into his own as an original producer, building a substantial catalog of work on the Caravan, Dakini, and Desert Trax labels and releasing two EPs of original music in 2015. He is a prolific remixer, lending his signature live percussion and melodic touch to the Desert Dwellers, Deya Dova, David Starfire, and various traditional Arabic ensembles, with many more on the way. In addition, his music has been featured in numerous dance DVDs and theatrical productions.
2015 saw Drumspyder lighting up festival stages throughout the US and Canada, including Symbiosis, Sonic Bloom, Cascadia, Firefly, Kinnection, Astral Harvest,  and many more. Recently he had the honor of playing at the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in New York.

Erothyme,Chill/Mainstream,Bobby West,http://soundcloud.com/erothyme,erothyme@gmail.com,"Erothyme was born on planet Earth and has been making the jams since, like, forever, man! His sound is a majestic blend of overblown hyperbole and meaningless adjectives that actually have nothing to do with music. Each festy season he journeys across the land inducing immersive cutting-edge bassgasms and killin' it, bro. Scientific research suggests that he is freshy fresh and his tracks land in your ear like a dolphin gracefully diving into the surface of the ocean after doing a triple backflip in front of the setting sun. Erothyme founded the Perpetual Victory Machine at the beginning of time because he knew it was good to be on the winning team. Some people think that Erothyme doesn't be like he is, but he do.

Some praise for the 2014 full length album, Circadia:

""Really lovely, spacious, thoughtful, intelligent, subtle, atmospheric, emotional, tender, delicate, wonderous electronic music""
- Bluetech

""... leaves the listener blissfully lost within multiple layers of melodies, reverberated vocals, live instruments and gentle grooves that are all covered in well thought out electronic soundscapes...
‘Circadia’ is certainly a milestone in the new wave of downtempo electronic music & is a highly recommended listen for people of all ages and musical backgrounds.""
- Dekompress.net

""... a quality of composition almost unequalled... dreamogenic feeling... an invitation to fly away from one's sofa to the skies and tickle the clouds, to go for a walk in the greens somewhere, to watch closely a colony of ants at work from a high-placed branch... To all lovers of tranquillity: add it to your best-of folder... ""
- La Mojoteque

""Long-haired grass hymns sipping rays of sunlight in the Rockies.""
- Skogsgospel

""I love this music! We had it playing for first daughters birth!﻿""

Joney | J248,Chill/Mainstream,Jonas Schiefferdecker,http://soundcloud.com/joney,booking@audiolith.net,"booking@audiolith.net

Jonas Schiefferdecker, simply known as Joney, produces experimental electro music spanning almost all known genres. It will always make you dance, at times like a bopping drum’n’bass fanatic, or like a hopping breakbeat listener, like a trance-y spacecake and then sometimes like an ecstatic teenager. Why is it, that this Hamburg-based producer refuses to decide on one genre and stick to it? The reason for this is part of the message that Joney wants to send out to the (generally message-lacking) world of music. In the same way that cultural debris always creates new cultures, Joney grew up in and grew from the ruins of the dying youth cultures of the 90s. Flashbacks to times before TV-on-Demand and the internet, when the kids hung out in parks and under bridges with cheap sound systems. This retrospective however is neither melancholic nor retro: Joney doesn’t own any vinyl and instead he produces with a computer, a synth and sometimes his drum kit.
Joney’s debut LP “illowhead” was released on vinyl in 2013 and it is re-issued digitally by his new musical home base Audiolith on 28/08/2015. The record was celebrated and highly regarded for it’s experimental, genre-surpassing and brilliant production by both known DJs and relevant magazines. This trend is continued by the new EP “Retrovertigo” which will be released on Audiolith Records on 04/09/2015. The seven tracks were produced over the last 5 years, and have been perfected during numerous live shows in front of diverse audiences to be tracks that enchant and disturb the listener to a similar degree. They are a last resistance against consumerism and marketing trends. Anything goes, but nothing is easy. They pull people in just to alienate them. Perfectly planned ideas, realized in total chaos. Joney himself is just like his music: deadly serious and carefree, happy-go-lucky, reflected and ignorant at the same time. His enigmatic self and his musically fearless and open-minded creations might be what makes him notorious amongst the social circles of the Golden Pudel Club, East the Beat and Ill… However to find the real Joney, one would have to head out after 3am to find him amongst Hamburg’s club scene.",5228,97,http://www.facebook.com/ill.joney?v=app_4949752878,http://www.facebook.com/ill.joney?v=app_4949752878,http://twitter.com/joney808,,"http://www.joney.de

ComputerClub,Chill/Mainstream,Michael Gigantor,http://soundcloud.com/computerclub,presidentofthecomputerclub@gmail.com,"Bookings/Requests contact: presidentofthecomputerclub@gmail.com

BIO: The Computer Club sound first emerged from Gigantor's studio in 2007 when his single “Load Rocket” started gaining artist acclaim and making noise in the blog circuit. The song, one of the first completed by Gigantor under the geeky guise, carried Computer Club’s name into both traditional record label outlets and the burgeoning music blogosphere alike – a trend rarely seen in the heavily populated landscape of today’s dance music. Original songs like “Flat Response” and “Laptop Levitation” showcase Computer Club’s highly honed sound design and audio engineering skills, while his edits of Nine Inch Nails, Friendly Fires, Prince, and New Order illustrate his ability to adapt the best of the big names to the dancefloor.

Along with his impressive studio output, Computer Club is a well-accomplished DJ by any measure. His steady stream of gigs has him traveling to every corner of North America with regular stops in New York City, San Francisco and everywhere in between. From rocking a strong crowd at L.A.’s Electric Daisy Carnival to dropping an intimate set for his former home of Atlanta, Computer Club constantly exhibits his deftness and versatility behind the decks.

While remixes of Combichrist's ""Throat Full Of Glass,"" Mr. Oizo’s “Flat Beat,” Jewel Kid's ""Break My Heart"" and his notorious collaborative re-working of Konflict’s Drum & Bass anthem “Messiah” with Le Castle Vania have helped propel his name to new heights, Computer Club also released an EP titled “Nerd Secrets,” which to showcases a wide swath of musical styles, ranging from dancefloor-filling, hands-in-the-air bangers to rock-inspired songwriting to experimental dancefloor weirdness. Among the tunes on ""Nerd Secrets"" was the heavy hit 'Losing Streak,' featuring vocals by UK pop genius Frankmusik, this tune charted in the top 40 in the UK and also went to number 1 on hypemachine.

In 2013 Computer Club released the ""Win Or Lose EP"" which featured collaborations with rising stars MUST DIE!, Anna Yvette and Gosteffects, also included remixes from Infuze, Rule Of Eight, and Prototype Raptor. Along with the attention that this release garnered, Computer Club continued to make noise with the release of another MUST DIE! collab, ""Payback,"" on Never Say Die Records, and made the blog circuit once again go nuts for his drum and bass reworking of Daft Punk's ""Doin It Right.""

In addition to his Computer Club moniker, Mike continues to push the boundaries of dance music as one third of Evol Intent, a hard-hitting Drum & Bass trio considered by many fans and DJs alike to be the genre’s most talented American group. Initially known as purveyors of the toughest brand of D&B, their debut album “Era of Diversion” exhibits a musical variety influenced by everyone from Radiohead and Aphex Twin to Slayer and N.W.A.

HULK : BroTown Recs : CLAW 


www.hulkstep.com

“Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” - Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

Since 2009, HULK has walked the earth.  Four long years of audio-conquest, leaving in his wake a scorched land of shattered teeth, broken hearts and ecstasy.  Warlord and alchemist, warrior and poet, HULK has delivered unto the people the truth of sound and forever branded his name into the annals of dubstep.

As the sun sets on his victorious back and the world grows dark, HULK’s gaze falls on those lands yet unconquered.  

He has raged under numerous banners: Rottun Records, SubHuman Records and HULK’s own label, BroTown Records, making him a mercenary monster, a pitiless beast without faction, who delights only in the ripe joy of bass.

His righteousness of rage has been vindicated by some of the genre’s biggest names and beyond:  Modestep, Excision, Dieselboy, Swishahouse and iwrestledabearonce to name just who have worked alongside HULK.  With the reputation of a solid collaborator, 2013 will provide no relief - A huge remix for Public Enemy is impending.

2013 will also bring an unavoidable monthly podcast of fresh and current music, new releases on the BroTown label, and brand new HULK and BroTown merchandise to clothe the huddled masses.

HULK will also demonstrate a warlord’s generosity this year by launching monthly music giveaways with his, “Fresh Fry-Daze”, starting off with an all HULK produced live mix.

Run.  Cower.  Embrace the inevitable.  Whatever you do, HULK cannot, will not be stopped as he marches his new lineup in an endless, bass driven precession across the world.

It’s time for a FUNK phenomena! For over two decades Rafael Ximenez and Mikio Gruschinske have each worked their way up the DJ Community and electronic music industry ladder. The duo met in 2002 at a club in Cologne, Germany where Gruschinske was a resident and Ximenez was booked as a guest. Shortly thereafter they realized their musical tastes and styles fit together and a brotherhood was born. Not long after they formed PLASTIK FUNK. The duo would go on to be known the quintessential music producers for some of dances more standout sounds; an updated version of Hip-House reinvented for the new EDM world. 

Over the years they have sparked the interest of fellow DJs with their releases. Like their collaboration ‘Who’ with Tujamo which became a worldwide hit; played by the likes of Tiesto, Steve Angello, Nicky Romero and Afrojack. Since its success Plastik Funk has consistently gained peak positions on the international dance and Beatport charts. Their most popular release ""Dr.Who! (Original Mix), cracked the top 20 on the overall UK singles chart. 

Plastik Funk's touring schedule has led them from Brazil to Korea and everywhere in between. Summer 2014 was a record breaking season playing for Tomorrowland, Pacha NYC, Castle Chicago, a full Asia Tour and landing a residency at NeonSplash at Privilege in Ibiza. All apexed with a personal invite from global superstar, Avicii to play at the world famous Ushuaia in Ibiza as part of his Sunday night residency. 

Their latest release is going to be a collab with their homies from Slovenia Vanillaz and Kosta Radman, released through Flamingo Records, already being premiered by #hardwell on his radioshow: Hardwell on air. So what’s next for Plastik Funk? The duo have several new releases on the horizon, they have kicked off their new #FunkYouVeryMuch Monthly Radio Show and are continuing to tour worldwide keeping their life of course full & funky.

With his current productions rocking dance floors worldwide, Rotterdam’s Benny Royal, is at the top of his game. 
Carving out a niche in a highly competitive scene, Benny’s impeccable production skills
and energetic DJ sets have made him a highly sought after commodity.

Inspired by a love of House music from an early age, Benny broke through onto the scene with the track, 
Keep on Moving; a Dutch House track with a catchy, tribal beat. Released on DJ Madskillz’ label, 
the track became a major club hit in his native Holland, garnering support from major Djs, 
including the legendary Roger Sanchez, who has been a staunch supporter of his career ever since.

By 2008, Benny’s career was genuinely on the up. His finely-tuned production skills led to his tracks 
gaining support from major players in the dance scene and achieving success on the dance charts. 
Encouraged by friend and fellow producer, Robbie Taylor, Benny submitted an entry for Toolroom Records’ 
remix competition for Dirty South’s track “Minority”. Of course, Benny’s remix won the competition! 
This was subsequently a major breakthrough for Benny, as the track became a Top 10 track on the world’s leading download portals. 
Racking up one of Toolroom’s best-selling track for some months, Benny had finally arrived.

Further success followed as Benny played clubs and festivals worldwide, where he became a household name on the international DJ scene, 
releasing tracks on major labels including: 
Stealth Records, Toolroom Records, Spinnin' Records, Ultra Records, Stereo Productions, 303 Lovers, Nervous Records and Urbana Records.

Benny’s productions have seen him work with Kid Massive (UK), Abel Ramos (Spain), Chris Keaser (France), 
Jorge Montia (Spain), Etienne Ozborne (Canada), Peter Gelderblom (NL), Ralvero (NL) and many others. 
His track, Let the Beat Hit ‘Em, with Dennis van Der Geest has achieved staggering success hitting #1 on Holland’s biggest download portal Dance Tunes.

An in demand DJ, Benny has played at numerous events worldwide including: 
Russia (Khabarovsk, Moscow), Turkey, Curacao, South Africa (tour), England (London, Brighton), Spain, Austria, Belgium, Germany (Official Love Parade after party). 
In 2011, Benny played the Dance Valley Main stage; one of Holland’s biggest festivals, alongside industry heavyweights: 
Avicii, Steve Angelo, Koen Groeneveld and DJ Madskillz. In addition he has supported Roger Sanchez, playing at his Stealth Records event at Ministry of Sound (UK).

Aside for official tracks and remixes, it is his Bootlegs, which have become major successes in their own rights. 
Most notable is his mix of UK singer Adele’s Rolling in the Deep, which has further bolstered his reputation 
as an in-demand producer and even gained highly coveted radio play on BBC Radio 1.

An experimental DJ; Benny is open to many sounds and styles. While admittedly he harbours a love of Tribal and Tech House, 
he is adept enough to churn out a quality club banger for the commercial club scene.

Benny has also enjoyed commercial success behind the scenes engineering and ghost producing productions for acts such as 
Flo Rida and Lil’ Wayne. Notably, the track, Higher, with Billy the Kit & Nathan Duvall hit #3 in the Buzz Chart.

2013 is kicking off with a bang with his collaboration with Etienne Ozborne on the track, Can You Feel It, 
getting signed to Zulu Records. With a remix by Abel Ramos, both mixes ended up in the Beatport Top 100, 
receiving support and accolades from: Fedde Le Grand, Afrojack, Bob Sinclar and Erick Morillo to name a few. 
His Bootleg of the all-time-classic, Night Train, has been snapped up as an official remix for Urbana. 
With many more exciting collaborations on the cards, the future is looking bright for this talented young producer. Watch this space.

DENNIS QUIN,Chill/Mainstream,Dennis Quin,http://soundcloud.com/dennis-quin-official,info@dennisquin.com,"Dennis Quin is a real House fanatic from the early days, focussed on bringing the combination of classyness and energetic sounds in his productions. Though not old-fashioned but enriching his todays style with timeless elements from the past.

Releases on:
Simma Black (Low Steppa imprint)
GetTwistedRecords (Tough Love imprint)
D-Vine Sounds (Sam Divine imprint)
Inhouse Recordings (Todd Terry imprint)
Flamingo Recordings (Housequake tracks co produced)

Remixes on:
Mixmash / Island Records (Chocolate Puma - Step Back)
la musique fait la force (Licensed by Defected, Gotsome - Bassline)



It all started way back in 1993 when Quin got hooked with House music. Buying and spinning vinyl records. Playing the piano at age 15, he now uses his musicality and has become a professional producer, knowing and determining each key to the very right proportion. Not only the drive but also the musicallity is Quin’s trademark when it comes to building and writing tracks.

Though Quin just started producing since the year 2011 he is fully focussed on bringing an own sound. Sometimes a bit raw and with oldskool elements, not fearing analogue sounds combining with clean synth sounds, but always fit into that specific ""Quin"" Fingerprint sound.


His style can be described as Deep / Sexy and with UK Garage influences. but also a straight groove fit within experimental sounds and a way the track starts after an intro break, rather than predictable. 

With his Vinyl turntable skills, Quin’s experience reaches much further than just beatmixing digitally.

As a DJ Dennis is not to be missed behind the decks, both Physically and sound-wise. Creating that unique goosebump feeling from the beginning till the end. He’s allways focussed on enjoyment and interaction with his crowd. Combining his specially crafted edits and live addition of looping and using additional acapellas.

Quin is taking the vibe to another level with his own productions and well selected tunes.

It all started with Wu-Tang & Daft Punk. What began as a hobby scratching records at 13 has since turned Mikey Lion into one of the fastest rising DJs in the US. After honing his skills during a 4 month residency at Super-club Razzmatazz, Barcelona in 2009, Mikey returned home with a love for tribalistic grooves grooves and the passion to leave his mark on the world. Upon his return, Mikey became a Resident DJ at Lovelife, San Diego’s premier House & Techno party, playing alongside the likes of Lee Burridge, Noir, Justin Martin, & Blondish among others. Shortly thereafter, a brief stint at club Bang Bang saw Mikey join forces with the likes of Seth Troxler, Damian Lazarus, Cajmere, & The Martinez Brothers.

But when playing club land began to run it's course, Mikey searched for something more. Trips to Burning Man and Lightning in a Bottle Festival left Mikey brimming with inspiration, so he set off with his best friends Lee Reynolds, Marbs, Deep Jesus, Kristoff and his younger brother, Porkchop, to create a new kind of festival.  One that was based entirely on House, Techno, and Love...

In November 2012, a band of renegades set off deep into the Mojave and Desert Hearts was born. A 70 hour no holds barred marathon of music, Desert Hearts has quickly become one of the premier underground parties in the world with Resident Advisor calling it “One of America’s best electronic music experiences.” Pulse Radio also listed Desert Hearts in their list of “Best Boutique Festivals To Do Before You Die” while THUMP ranked it as the #3 festival in North America. 

With a string of releases set for 2015, an incredible movement behind him, and Desert Hearts Records taking off under his lead, life has never felt so good and it’s only getting better...",7215,62,https://www.facebook.com/MikeyLionMusic,https://www.facebook.com/MikeyLionMusic,https://twitter.com/djmikeylion,,,5,tim@clandestine-artists.com

Full Intention duo Michael Gray and Jon Pearn need no introductions. Spreading their dominating sound across the house music scene for the last fifteen years, the pair have secured a seemingly non-stop string of successful top 40 releases and remixes, escalating the twosome to true global status, but never losing the connection to the underground House scene. 

Full Intention have worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, like Paloma Faith, Duke, Jamiroquai, George Michael, Whitney Houston, Barbara Tucker, Mood 2 Swing, Junior Jack, Brandy, Ultra Nate, Aly-us, Fish go Deep & Jennifer Lopez – and not to forget the Grammy nomination for their remix of George Michael’s “Amazing”. So no wonder their innovating sound had a huge impact on the whole scene and influenced many other big producers.
 
In 2005 Full Intention decided to take a break while Michael Gray and Jon Pearn focused on their solo work but now they are back together with a string of strong releases and DJ sets for labels like Defected, Off Recordings, Suara & Rebirth.

Remix enquiries please contact:- stimpy@concretepromo.com

There are a few artists that are synonymous with the term ‘House Music’, those acts that have become so ingrained in the conception of the sound that the simple resonance of their name brings a vibe to mind.  Gary Dedman and Kevin Andrews created such a pseudonym when they joined forces to create the “Hoxton Whores”.

Following an unplanned conception, the Hoxton Whores quickly became a much-loved feature on the dance music circuit. Initially coming together to write and produce music, their lovechild soon morphed into an extremely successful partnership that continues to rock dance floors all over the world to this day.
All remix inquiries please contact  stimpy@concretepromo.com

As artists they are signed to some of the most prestigious house labels in the scene. In the last 12 months alone the list includes: Ministry of Sound, Great Stuff, Toolroom, Subliminal, Stealth, Deeperfect, Hotfingers and Suara who have all snapped up originals and remixes from this talented partnership. These tracks have also gone on to feature on countless compilation albums that have sold thousands upon thousands in territories all over the globe. 

The Hoxton Whores collaborations with other titanic musicians like Deep Dish, Paul Johnson, Blue Boy, Double Exposure, Robbie Rivera and many more have showcased their immense diversity and ability to inject a unique Hoxton Whore flavour to even the biggest and boldest releases, nothing is daunting and everything is an relished challenge. 

Their label, Whore House Recordings, was launched in 2007 to allow them to expand their discography, explore more avenues within House music and to present their army of followers with even more tantalising productions that have rocketed up the charts. With nearing 100 releases under their belts, #1s on Beatport, Trackidown and DJDownload, rave reviews in the media, huge support from the heavyweights within the music business and artists jumping at the chance to stand up for remix duties, we think it’s safe to say Whore House Recordings has weighted itself as a cornerstone in House. 

When it comes to touring it would be easier to name where they haven’t played but we’ll list some of the most prestigious. Glastonbury - one of the biggest festivals in the world, done.  H20 Festival in South Africa, ticked off. MTV Dance Festival, Groove Garden in Holland, Colours Festival, touring Brazil, Australia, China, America, Africa, Russia, all through Europe including holding residencies in the legendary party island itself; Ibiza. They’ve done it all. An envious diary of the biggest, best and most infamous parties in the world have called upon the Hoxton Whores to deliver what they know best – Chunky, Groovy, Beat Laden, Vocal Dusted, Proper House Music.

With House music coursing through their veins it was always inevitable that they launched their own night. In 2004 Whore House hit the circuit to a fanfare welcome and has continued to pull in the crowds year on year, whatever country to has decided to call home, they’ve packed out venues! Seasons in Ibiza, a London residency and with their latest Chelmsford residency already this year having welcomed the likes of D.Ramirez, Prok & Fitch and BBC Radio 1’s Danny Howard to all rock the dance floor plus countless tour nights across the world. 

How do you sum up an act like the Hoxton Whores? We could continue to mention their impressed list of global hits like ‘Friday Saturday Love’ on Ministry of Sound, ‘Hoxtons vs Cream’ on Universal, we could waffle on about the intensity of a Whore House night with it’s Burlesque theme and hedonistic heat or maybe we could reel off more colossal artists that have called on their remix skills like Danny Howels, David Morales and K-Klass. 

Or, we could sum up the Hoxton Whores in just a few words –

Unique, passionate, immaculate, talented, legendary.

Front woman Anna M’Queen, keyboardists/programmers Nathan Barlowe and Zach Hall, and drummer Shane Wise grind heavy synth riffs into an undeniably catchy sound that’s rooted in old-school punk, new school electronic and pure, unadulterated pop. They have scored three Top 10 Dance hits with “The Rising,” “Sugar” and “Savages,” their songs have been remixed by UZ, Jauz, Chris Lake, Pretty Lights and more, and the Eddie Amador remix of “The Rising” was nominated for the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording.

They began organizing legendary concept parties and festivals around Eastern Europe. At the same time they started building their first professional DJ booking agency in Bulgaria - E-booking 2001 www.e-bookingdj.com and Pepo & Pacho's first record label - Ellectrica Recordings www.ellectricarecordings.com in 2007.

Mohducis,Chill/Mainstream,Moh Ducis,http://soundcloud.com/mohducis,mohducisbooking@gmail.com,"BIO
Introduction

Over the past 10 years Moh ducis has fused the individual identities of electronic dance music through his melodic progressive bigroom sound. Moh is one the fastest rising talents in the evolving global dance music spectrum .and his inimitable unique sound with seamless mixing and innate tune selection makes him a great dj

“This is the way that I like to see the art of DJing: It is playing a set which builds towards something, whether it’s telling a story, or creating a journey.  And Yes, of course with adding few big records to the mix. Most importantly, it’s not about the big hits you play but, its all about how crafty you can be in manipulating the sound to fit the dance floor to create memories”.

Music 
Moh’s remixes and bootlegs have had great support from the biggest names in the scene for many years. Summer of 2012 is a highlight of his dj career when most of his productions hit the mainstream audience in full force with over thousands of daily listeners and downloads around the world. The United sates, United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and Spain are among the top five countries with daily listeners to his music. 2012 bootleg smashes include tunes from Rihanna, Afrojack, Corbra Starship, Swedish house mafia, Amloop, Oasis and Skrillex. In early 2012, Moh launched his monthly Club-Box podcast series to give the fans a clear vision about his club sound. “Abstract median” podcast will showcase multiple sides of the Moh’s sound – from aggressive to soulful to dark and yet always pleasing. Furthermore, His productions run parallel to his live innovative dj sets. And fans can expect loads of exciting new releases and live remix projects in the coming months ahead.

Early History
Earlier in Moh’s career at the age of 17, the dance music awakening came about when he was schooling in London where he played his very first gig. Electronic music scene was on the rise in the UK and Moh was exposed to all forms of music genres at a younger age. Moby, Chemical Brothers, New Order, Prodigy and Infected Mushroom were some of Moh’s musical idols growing up. Moh caught his first break when he was offered a weekly dj residency at Café de Paris and then went on to take over another residency at Café Caprice in London.
Having fixed focus between trance & progressive, he began to reach audiences in and around London. Moh pulled an early calm when his was offered a monthly residency in his heartland at Peppemint club in Dubai where he was privileged to open the stage for various worlds’ renowned djs; Trance legends likes of, Kaitracid, Binary-Finary John Askew, John Digweed and Carl Cox, Paul Okenfold to name a few.

In 2005 Moh released his first EP  “Bio electric wave”  on Prepectives Digital records. His remix for “Chasing cars by Snow Patrol” gave him the first global recognition as this was an important turning point in Moh’s dj career. Due to an intense dj schedule, most of the production work had to be pushed back. His long anticipated original productions are in near completion with multiple on going projects in the pipeline.

“The music production is something that I have wanted to get out of my system for a very long time and now that I am doing it I am only kicking myself that I didn't get it sorted sooner. And finally I’m excited to complete my unfinished work”

****************************

German/Colombian DJ and producer Freddy Verano is without doubt one of the hottest newcomers on the House scene right now. Collaborations with Felix Jaehn, Moewe and De Hofnar helped launch him to notoriety in 2014, when several of his productions made the Top 3 of the Hypem charts. Then, in early 2015, he put his foot to the floor and has been tearing up the fast lane ever since:

His first single ""Moments"", with vocals by none other than Grammy Award winner Sam Smith, hit the market in February 2015 and has scored more than 5 million Spotify plays to date. The follow-up track ""Your Woman"" was then featured worldwide on the Tomorrowland compilation in June 2015. His remixes are gaining ever more international attention too, Freddy Verano is one of a select few artists to contribute an official remix to ""Mr Cheerleader"" OMI's album. 

Now, Freddy Verano is bringing out his newest single: ""Comets"". The fantastic vocals on the track were contributed by the charming French/Argentinian singer Natalia Doco. There's a lively debate going on in the (House) scene right now about who might be the next German DJ/producer to put together a major international career after Robin Schulz and Felix Jaehn. Listening to ""Comets"", you can't help but think that Freddy Verano is first in line. ""Comets"" feat. Natalia Doco, the new single by Freddy Verano, available in spring 2016.

Copia Doble Systema nació en Copenhague, Dinamarca 2009. Nosotros adoptamos el movimiento de la Cumbia Digital, el cual fusionó la música electrónica con variados ritmos latinos. Todo comenzó por mi experimento, de bajarle el tempo al techno, agregar la cumbia y  diversos loops, con lo que me sentí muy satisfecho y en casa musicalmente. Decidí (Copyflex) montar la banda con el danés Jens Fokking, un productor de jungle.

Rápidamente comenzamos a producir y tocar en constelaciones grandes y pequeñas. A veces como un trio, y otras con una orquesta de hasta 11 personas! Ahora estamos haciendo shows por todo el mundo con diferentes colaboradores. Nuestra gama de locaciones varía desde casas ocupa, fiestas de barrio, deslumbrantes clubs en El Cairo hasta la Biblioteca Real de Copenhague. Todo el mundo necesita la cumbia vikingo! Hasta el momento Copia Doble Systema ha conseguido presentarse en un sin número de eventos al aire libre y bajo techo en Dinamarca. Entre los mejores estan: el Festival de Distortion (Copenhague), Roskilde Festival zona de camping y RAW. También hemos estado en el extranjero! Mágicos momentos en el carnaval de Notting Hill (Londres), en Hanoi, Caracas, Stavanger, Malmö, Gales y las Islas Feroe.

ENGLISH:

Copyflex started Copia Doble Systema in Copenhagen, Denmark 2009, heavily taken by the digital cumbia that fused electronic music and local beats of South America. By slowing down techno and adding cumbia loops, we I really felt at home. The first crew was consisting of norwegian dj and musician, Copyflex and danish producer Jens Fokking.

We quickly started to produce and do shows in larger and smaller constellations, sometimes as a trio, and maxing it with an orchestra of 11 people! Now we're doing shows all over the world with different collaborators. Our range of venues goes from squats, block parties and glitzy clubs in Cairo to the Royal Library in Copenhagen. Everybody needs the vikingo cumbia! So far Copia Doble Systema has managed to play countless indoor and outdoor events in Denmark, some of the best ones being the Distortion Festival (Copenhagen), Roskilde Festival Camping Area and R.A.W. shows.  We have also been overseas! Magic moments at the Notting Hill Carnival (London), in Hanoi, Caracas, Stavanger, Malmö, Wales and the Faroese Islands.

Copia Doble Systema is now getting support from major players like Diplo (Mad Decent, Major Lazer), Gilles Peterson (BBC), El Hijo De La Cumbia (Bersa Discos), Dj Sinden (Grizzly, Domino, KissFM), Toy Selektah (Mad Decent), Villa Diamante (ZZK) and Schlachthofbronx (Man Recordings, Disco B) amongst others.

We are also very proud to (have) work(ed) with great artists such as Fauna, El Hijo De La Cumbia, Douster, Dj Mouse, Boody B, El Remolon, Dj Hvad, System, Mo Fire, Doma Tornados, dj/Rupture, MAFFI, Uproot Andy, Schlachthofbronx and many more.",12134,61,http://www.facebook.com/pages/COPIA-DOBLE-SYSTEMA,http://www.facebook.com/pages/COPIA-DOBLE-SYSTEMA,http://twitter.com/copyflex,http://youtube.com/copyflex,,3,postworldagency@gmail.coms.e.l.e.k.t.o.r.ex@gmail.com

""The D.C.-born, L.A.-based duo Nadastrom come from different backgrounds, but share a ravenous appetite for extremes. From producing genre bending club anthems to house & techno groovers, Dave and Matt have been praised in the pages of Spin and Rolling Stone, pumped on the airwaves of BBC Radio 1 and NPR, and revered at nightclubs and festivals across the planet.

Nadastrom's sound has never been lacking in creativity. In 2007 when they first signed to Dave ""Switch"" Taylor's Dubsided imprint, their debut EP ""Pussy"" immediately rose to the top of the Beatport charts. Along with pioneering the fusion genre Moombahton in 2009, they've remixed, produced and toured with some of the biggest names in music including Skrillex, M.I.A. and Kid Cudi.

In 2010, the duo relocated from their hometown of Washington D.C. to Los Angeles, treading new sonic ground and finding comfort in fresh surroundings. Their adventurous DJ sets and productions landed them regular invites to world-renowned L.A. club institutions such as The Do-Over, Low End Theory, and A Club Called Rhonda. They've even hosted and curated several stages and events for Hard's Day Of The Dead and Holy Ship! festivals.

Nadastrom's most recent output explores a stronger, more refined melodic house sound, while maintaining their original style and influences. This is most notable in their 2015 self-titled debut album on L.A. label Friends Of Friends & Dubsided. During its release, Nadastrom broke the top electronic albums chart on iTunes and was praised in influential media outlets such as Pitchfork and Resident Advisor. LA Weekly called it one of the ""Best L.A. Albums of 2015"" while Entertainment Weekly described it as ""boundary breaking with an unexpected pop edge.""

With a near decade of consistent touring, releases, and accolades under their belt, Nadastrom continue to move crowds and dance floors worldwide. And through their signature style and exploration in dance music and club culture, Dave and Matt manage to keep audiences anticipating their every move.""

Josh Gard has had a long history in music, and lately he has been rapidly rising up the ranks for all things bass. Just a few short years ago he donned the name Figure and began making electro house, but has since become a regular name in all realms of electronic and dance. Scoring positions among the charts may have gotten him recognition, but a hefty amount of praise has been raining down on him lately as some of the leading artists in electronic music have valued his live performance skills as some of the best in the business.

""Raised on his parents’ music taste - Huddersfield born DJ Q began his musical journey from a very young age. At the tender age of 12 he began garnering records and tapes and was already beginning to integrate himself into a flourishing UK Garage scene before amassing enough 12”s to warrant the purchase of his very first set of decks. 3 years on at 15, a self taught DJ Q had honed the skills sufficient to earn him his first bookings at local parties and unknowingly laid the foundations of a career. 

First rising to eminence through the release of ‘You Wot’ - which was picked up by Ministry of Sound in the summer of 2008 and subsequently made its way in to the UK top 50 - DJ Q then stepped into the world of remixing and began building his portfolio reworking material from the likes of Amy Winehouse, Dizzee Rascal, Keri Hilson and Katy B to name a few. 

Since then, Q has built an extolled and varied catalogue that has touched the likes of Local Action, Butterz, Party Like Us, Unknown To The Unknown and his own imprint Q Recordings and has held down radio residencies at Ministry of Sound, BBC Radio 1Xtra and most recently Kiss FM through which his own Kiss Fresh show airs every Friday from 7 until 9.  

A regular across the UK festival circuit, his hard work has also seen him travel the world having recently headlined his own Australia and New Zealand tour as well as playing shows in the US, Canada and across Europe.

Now - a lauded stalwart of UK Garage and House - DJ Q continues to maintain variety and dynamism in his productions. Either as a radio host or headline DJ he has earned his stripes and his rep as a musician whose shows, broadcasts and releases are not to be missed out on.""",44921,44,http://facebook.com/djqmusic,http://facebook.com/djqmusic,http://www.twitter.com/djqmusic,,"http://www.djqmusic.com/

Aries UK,Chill/Mainstream,Aries,http://soundcloud.com/aries-uk,Aries@AriesDubs.com,"Aries Bio :
Reggae and Jungle are genres of music with strong roots in the UK and Aries has immersed himself in both cultures which has heavily influenced his whole ethos to production and DJing. It is this integrity and dedication to the scene which has earned him respect amongst his peers meaning he now flies the flag internationally for modern day sound-system culture.

Aries’ sound combines vintage Jungle sensibilities with traditional Reggae music polished off with modern day production techniques. The finished product is his own Dubwise strain of the UK’s one true homegrown genre, Jungle.

He broke through to the A-list of the Jungle world after releasing music on legendary record labels: Congo Natty, Dread and V Recordings, plus Aries has recorded with a whole world of vocal talent that does by no means stop at Top Cat, David Boomah, Solo Banton, Nanci & Phoebe, Demolition Man, Jah Mason and Johnny Osbourne. His DJing is in demand across the globe having played high profile DJ sets in most major countries.

Back in 1990, Aries launched himself onto Pirate Radio in his hometown of Birmingham where Reggae and underground Dance music were dominating the airwaves. This is where he learned his craft as a DJ. He then promoted himself to throwing parties and finally graduated to the recording studio where he has been creating music ever since.

Aries’ projects vary from his solo exports to collaborations with other producers from Gold Dubs and Kelvin 373 to the Chopstick Dubplate crew, which is the world’s first international Reggae Jungle sound crew which is fronted by himself, Jacky Murda and Tuffist. Recently, he has also been touching on other projects from Hip Hop to Dubstep which all tell an ode of his roots.

Within the reputedly closed doors of the Jungle Drum & Bass world, true support is carried by your peers and it is they who validate your career. Aries has been met with open arms by figureheads of the scene. In the mainstream, Aries receives radio play from BBC’s Toddla T, Zane Lowe, Rob Da Bank and DJ Hype plus his Youtube views reach the millions. This is all from one of the most humble people you are likely to meet in the music business.

It is undoubtedly true that Aries will continue his ongoing plight to serve the world true grassroots Dubwise Jungle dubplates. Whether it be releasing his own music, collaborating on projects or running record labels, Aries will be pushing the sound that he loves.

It all began in 2003. 2007 turned out to be especially successful - that's when Enei released his first record on the Dutch label Fokuz. That's when he also strated producing dubstep, which resulted in the second dubstep vinyl release in Russia, including one solo track and two co-produced tracks with Ka (aka Implex). More releases are coming on the biggest European labels, and more collaborations with producers from all over the world are taking place. In his sets Enei mixes old-school neuro funk and tech step with fresh and trendy futuristic minimal dnb from Metalheadz, Critical and other labels. His tracks are played by Nu Tone, Heist, Ed Rush, Sabre, DJ Hype, London Elektricity, Bulletproof, Soul Intent, Utah Jazz, Bailey and many others.",30995,47,http://www.facebook.com/eneiofficial,http://www.facebook.com/eneiofficial,http://twitter.com/eneimusic,,"http://www.criticalmusic.com/artist/enei/

Von D,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/vond,myriam.kanou@gmail.com,"Management / Bookings: myriam.kanou@gmail.com / laure-camilleri@migal-productions.com 
France -based DJ and producer, Von D, is renowned for his ability to fill dance floors, fuse genres and hold his own in collaborations with some of the biggest names in underground music. Regularly playing guest mixes on Rinse FM and Kiss FM, he’s recognised for featuring exclusive and unreleased dubstep tunes, alongside his own music. Having played across Europe, the USA and Asia, and with upcoming tours in America, New Zealand and Australia his worldwide fan base is testament to his skill.
 
Von D’s musical journey began with a worn drum kit and a love of dub and jungle, which led him to cut his professional teeth working as a sound engineer. These contributed to his deep understanding of rhythm, and  this strong technical grounding is at the centre of his eclectic and intuitive mixing style establishing him as a true heavyweight of bassweight.
 
He already has releases on Skream’s Disfigured Dubz, Jakes Hench Records, Boka, Black Acre and the seminal V Recordings under his belt, and his music’s been remixed by giants of the genre. He’s worked with industry legends including the Foreign Beggars; Show Me, possibly his biggest hit to date, is featured on the  Dubstep Allstar Compilation on Tempa and Soul Jazz Records; and recent release Wicked Pharoah has been selected as Mixmag’s ‘Tune Of The Month’ (May 2013).
 
2013 will see Von D continue to make his mark on the scene with the forthcoming release of three tracks on the Get Darker label; with a second album in the pipeline and support from big industry names.
 
Embracing the buzz of performing, and feeding on the energy of fellow music-lovers, Von D continues to evolve his style and sound, touring worldwide and setting night after club night on fire.

Leeds based DJ's/producers renowned for their bangers, mashup's and sweet tasting gravy.

Reaching back to 88 when I first heard and experienced it in the clubs and underground parties of my native manchester, and looking forward to the future....it's more vibrant and relevant than ever!!!
 Strictly political, proud to be underground,trying to be true to my roots, tell my story as a jazz musician, crate digger and dj, pay my dues and spread the love.... This is house music....always more about 'us' than 'me'....it's not about popstars, it's about dancefloors.....humanity sharing positive energy TOGETHER.... as simple and yet as deep as it gets.....and subversive as fuck!

Mike Metro is just a guy that writes bass-driven house music out of his humble cottage nestled in the mountains.

He likes to play his music to lots of people at lots of places, Australia-wide (Revolver / Chinese Laundry / Electric Circus) and festivals Splendour In The Grass, Stereosonic and Future Music Festival. He then releases those tracks via his own label Medium Rare Recordings, as well as remixes for Sweat It Out, One Love and Ministry of Sound.

When Mike’s not in the studio you can find him meditating, riding his bike up steep hills and exploring all that this world has to offer.

Venelli,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/venelli,vmuzik@live.co.,"Contact information: vmuzik@live.co.uk

In the age where music is looked upon as expendable and rarely significant, one artist is striving to have his voice heard, and to prove it is the music that matters. Creating music has become part of his everyday life, treated with the same importance as eating and sleeping, “I work every hour available, always thinking about my next project, next idea”. To this artist the passion towards his music means more than the potential wealth. “I don’t make music that sounds the same. Every song is different, a different vibe, sound, feeling, memory, I make the music I like”.

Not many are willing to fight against the tide of commercial sound, “my music is based on feelings, my thoughts, goals, achievements, I write and create songs with the intention of taking the listener to another place, make them forget where they are, even if it is for a few minutes. If I do that, then I have been successful”.

Wick-it the Instigator is a multi-genre DJ and producer known as a breath of fresh air in an otherwise over-crowded EDM scene. His SoundCloud page is one of the top 200 most active pages on the entire site, garnering more then 40,000 followers and over 7 MILLION plays. Impressive numbers like these, which recently landed him at #5 on Billboard's Next Big Sound chart, aren’t just a testament to his top-notch production skills, but also his keen ability to build and harness a highly interactive online fan base (1,500+ Facebook Fans added weekly). In 2012, Microsoft recognized that direct audience connection and chose Wick-it to produce a song for their Windows 8/Angry Birds: Star Wars commercial that they blasted to millions of prime-time viewers. With successful headline tours supplemented by huge sets at major festivals, it’s obvious his talent and success extend far beyond the studio.

Strangely enough for an artist named Ed Solo, this prolific producer used to be best known for his collaborations with other artists. Deekline, Krafty Kuts, Skool of Thought, drum 'n' bass legend Brockie - all have benefited from getting Ed alongside them in the studio. The east London lad who grew up listening to pirate radios and cut his teeth as a production assistant at the famous Sour studios really is a Jedi master of sonic science: drop the needle on an Ed Solo record and you'll soon know about it - no one makes club music that cuts through a soundsystem quite like him.&#13;
&#13;
And yet that moniker also - rightly - suggests a confidence in his ability to go out on his own, and Ed is an iconic artist on each of the drum 'n' bass, breaks and dubstep scenes. In the latter field, he's recently been creating a firestorm with Sludge Records, the label he co-runs with Deekline (the pair also run booty breaks imprint Hot Cakes together). &#13;
&#13;
Tracks such as Age of Dub and Atlantis have introduced younger clubbers to classic dance music sounds, throwing them through a skanked out half-time prism and bringing them back to the floor in full effect. They've also picked up support from iconic figures such as Kissy Sellout and Skream - this is a producer right at the heart of the zeitgeist.&#13;
&#13;
In the club, Ed is at the centre of one of the most innovative revolutionary shows of modern times, the Battlejam events run with production partner and UK DMC Champ JFB and UK beatbox champ Beardyman. Working together, the trio cut, scratch and loop up live audio recordings - some made by members of the crowd only seconds before - to create an entirely new, interactive, real-time experience.&#13;
&#13;
Having just returned from a spectacularly successful tour of Canada, Ed is ready to take things to the next level. Hold tight for some serious dancefloor mayhem in your area.&#13;

COSTELLO is a young French Dj & Producer, who has been raised listening to house and techno music for over than 15 years. He remarkably incarnates the freshness of those young artists who know how to sum up a decade of electronic culture, adding their own strength, skills and personal touch to it.First recognized by the electronic scene, playlisted, remixed and compiled by the biggest artists - his discography speaks for itself (Boysnoize, Fool's Gold, Bad Life, Dim Mak, Boxon, Southern Fried, Lektroluv...).

Costello carries on rising guided by a clear aspiration of what the dancefloors need. He is the avant-garde of a very groovy electronica which vacillates between house and techno and uses various immensely effective electro ingredients. It is not surprising that his tracks are renowned the world over and played by international acts such as Brodinski, Boys Noize, Louisaaah!!!... 

Boys Noize himself has selected one of his tracks in his mix on the «Fabric Live 72» compilation and recently released 2 EP’s « Pegasus » & « Taurus » on Boysnoize Records | BNRTRAX.

TWR72 is an Amsterdam based techno duo sharing the same predilection of music since their early teens. Now, almost two decades later, they still share this bond and are seen as the most thriving duo in the scene. TWR72 pioneers their own forward- thinking approach towards electronic music: a fusing and pulsing rhythm with a cutting drive, binding it with a strong signature groove.

In 2010 they celebrated their first successes with refreshing productions with which they have set a standard for many following young producers. With an even more progressed sound, they signed at Turbo Recordings and released several leading techno EP’s. Moreover, TWR72 released ‘Endless’; a locked groove masterpiece consisting of 72 loops. The cherry on the cake was their collaboration with LA’s most wanted producer, Truncate.

Their journey continued with the genesis of their own imprint Float Records in 2014. With this label they explore the combination of perfection and simplicity shown by both young, talented producers as well as renowned artists. In 2015 they released several EP’s on Planet Rhythm which were charted and played by the biggest artists out there.
2016 starts out well with their debut in techno’s most praised club, Berghain. Furthermore they have a new EP coming up on Float Records and several remixes for big artists are on the way.

Tracky, stripped-back and tough as hell, TWR72, delivers an ultra-lean cut of prime techno.

VanToth,Chill/Mainstream,Matthew Toth,http://soundcloud.com/vantoth,SD@tszgrp.com,"Van Toth, born on August 22, 1990 was raised in Miami, Florida. Currently residing there, his drive toward the art of music grew from an early age. Always learning and teaching himself, he began with his own guitar lessons at 13. The years bringing more awareness, at the age of 17 he began experimenting with FL Studio, bending his mind to grasp the basics of producing and recording. With exposure to the classic by Benny Benassi, “Satisfaction,” he was well on his way to fully realize the extent that was electronic music. Bringing it full circle during the 2008 Ultra Music Festival, he realized that this was his true passion: the desire for his self-acquired musical talent to be heard and felt by the receiving masses.
Within trial and error came his first success. After posting his productions on the forums of Laidback Luke, he was contacted by an English producer, loving his track “How You Feelin’,” with the intent of remixing the track. With the timely introduction to Don Steele by Rhythm Punkz, came his first release on Vinyl Pusher (Australia), subsequently followed by many more. He has also started releasing tracks with Sneakerz Muzik (Amsterdam), a sub label of Spinnin’ Records.

Van Toth has also began working with his partner, JWLS, in their side project ""GTA"". Backed by none others then Afrojack and Laidback Luke, his dynamic producing ability will only continue to expand. With these new opportunities this young and talented producer will show the world his own style of music.

alex@bassic.co

Artificial Intelligence aka A.I. are on top of the DnB game. The renowned production outfit behind the legendary “Desperado” tune—recipient of Radio 1’s esteemed accolade: ‘Number 1 Drum & Bass Tune of The Year’ 2006; and one of the greatest DnB tracks of all-time—comprises Zula Warner and Glenn Herweijer from London. For more than a decade the passionate pair have been studiously building upon their unique signature vibes in the Camden-based studio cave they call second home; cementing their position in the book of Drum & Bass with legendary tunes such as “Uprising”, “Bloodlines”, “Days Of Rage”, “Three's A Crowd” and of course Stand Alone— their exceptional debut artist album for V Recordings (2010).
Discovered by Marcus Intalex who picked up “Ever On” for his influential Soul:R label; in the same week “Soul Good” came out on Klute’s revolutionary Commercial Suicide imprint back in 2003; the hot duo swiftly signed by Bryan Gee to V Recordings shortly after.
Right now the duo are enjoying a rather unique position with the scene’s leading labels backing their new material. The massive “You Can Dream” EP hit Shogun Audio last month featuring longtime friend and soulster Steo backed with “Let You Go”—a collaboration with New Zealand’s finest, Tiki Taane. This followed on from their infamous “Dillirious” release dropping on the mighty Metalheadz and the pair’s recent remix of Jagga’s “Outta Control” featured as Friction’s ‘Remix Of The Week’ on BBC Radio 1. With lots of fresh forthcoming material due for 2014, highlights include a huge dancefloor smasher for UKF with America’s illustrious diva, Kathy Brown and a mesmerizing vocal project courtesy of DRS; An Ep for Metalheadz, the year already set to be one of their busiest yet. 

The full A.I. discography extends to all of the industry’s most established imprints: Metalheadz, Full Cycle, Good Looking, C.I.A., Innerground, Exit; numerous heavyweight remix projects from Eric Prydz to Kelis; and of course their own Integral Records platform—set up in 2006 for pushing groundbreaking music from artists they believed represented the movement’s future producers (which has largely rung true). Not forgetting, exciting news also includes a stunning remix of Lenzman for the highly anticipated Integral compilation album, due for release early 2014.

With heavyweight DJ reputations in parallel to their impressive production credentials, Artificial Intelligence are also renowned for delivering their fresh and versatile sets around the globe, headlining the world’s finest clubs and festivals. In their hometown of London, they regularly guest at Fabric and feature on all of the prestigious nights around the city—namely Hype's Tru Playaz, Andy C's Ram, Goldie’s Metalheadz, Marcus Intalex's A Bunch Of Cuts and nights presented by V Recordings. 

Make sure you keep your ear to the ground for more all-round A.I news as well as announcements for when Artificial Intelligence will be playing your city next!

Production Work Inquiries / Remixes etc. - www.alpinemastering.com

Multi-platinum record selling music producer, Glenn Morrison is the archetype of the modern DJ/producer star. The 30-year-old Toronto native is as happy rocking an underground house party as he is performing at an exclusive oceanic rooftop venue; as adept at composing an international club anthem like ‘Contact’ as he is at concocting a pop dance record that strikes to the Billboard Charts in America.  His single ‘Goodbye’ has been Certified Double Platinum and went Number 1 for 11 weeks in a row on the Canadian Billboard Chart, as well as going Number 1 in Russia’s Billboard Chart.  It wind up taking over Eastern Europe and became Number 1 in 7 Countries to date.

He is signed to Sony Records, Universal Music Group and Sony Music ATV as a writer, producer, & recording artist. He has been nominated for several Juno Awards in 2015, as well as Fans Choice Award / Dance Artist of the Year / Dance Record of the Year for Sirius XM Radio Music Awards, and won the SOCAN Dance Record of the Year 2015. 

Glenn has enjoyed the support of DJs as varied as John Digweed and Richie Hawtin to David Guetta and Tiesto. For three years he was resident at the world's best club, Ibiza’s Amnesia Club, and was a resident at Space in Ibiza for 1 year, as well as Space in Miami for 2 years. Last year, Glenn added the latest addition to his residency repertoire in his monthly night being held in Las Vegas at the acclaimed Moon Nightclub at the Palms Casino.  And he is perfecting a sinuous, hooky sound that combines the eerie beauty of pure techno with light rains of melody and flashes of emotion.

In short, Glenn Morrison is one of the most dynamic and accomplished talents in electronic music today. Period.

Morrison is a difficult DJ to pigeonhole and that’s what makes him such a fascinating talent. One minute his sound is ruthlessly minimal and funky; the next it’s washed in color and vocals and emotion.

Glenn has had an unusual career path. He started off as a classical pianist, a preteen prodigy, performing  – and winning – competitions. Then came a life-changing encounter with electronic music.

Production continues apace in the new mastering studio Morrison has built in Toronto, entitled Alpine Mastering (www.alpinemastering.com). Be it sound design for video game companies like Nintendo, EA Sports, Activision or Rockstar, or his own productions, he simply doesn’t stop making and playing music.  His latest partnership with IMAX has been a thrilling experience, pushing the boundaries of electronic music to that of sound-scoring live theatre visuals.  Glenn & IMAX unveiled this concept with a 3 part show series at the 2012 ComicCon event held at the Ruben H Fleet Science Centre in San Diego, and it was a huge success. “It’s been a liberating transition for me to make music for all different stylistic purposes, and I’m very grateful for having the ability to do what I love for a living” says Glenn.

Watch this brilliant artist over the course of 2015 as he will be reshaping and redefining how we perceive electronic music through an ample amount of live shows, performances, and recordings.

For most of us, our first connection with C.M.A. was at a meeting. A meeting usually takes place at a specific time and place where two or more addicts come together for the purpose of recovery. In contrast to a meeting, a C.M.A. group is a spiritual entity that exists beyond the specific time and place of the meeting for the purpose of carrying the message to the addict who still suffers. Regular meetings are encouraged to list their meeting time and place on local and national meeting lists. Groups are encouraged to register with C.M.A. World Services and elect service representatives to the Area Assembly. 

Whenever two or more addicts come together for the purpose of recovery they can form a C.M.A. group — providing that, as a group, they have no other affiliation. Each group's primary purpose should be to carry the message to the addict who still suffers. By Tradition, each group is autonomous, conducting itself as its members see fit, provided that its actions do not impact other groups or the C.M.A. Fellowship as a whole. C.M.A. does not govern individual meetings, instead relying upon the spiritual principles outlined in our Twelve Traditions and Traditions Concepts to guide each group's actions.

This versatile and prolific young artist has already gained support from the likes of DJs and producers such as Knife Party, Dillon Francis, DJ Craze, Tittsworth, Nadastrom and Munchi, Kissy Sell Out, Bro Safari, Diplo, and The Glitch Mob, to name a few. Their stamps of approval reveal LeDoom’s power as a genre-bending tastemaker. With his first EP “Doombah”, released on El Cuco Recordings, LeDoom managed to chart at #5 on the Beatport Indie Dance charts and earn the respect of gigging DJs, fellow producers and the electronic music community at large. Fast forward a bit, and LeDoom is consistently releasing quality new music that charts in the Beatport Top 100 across multiple genres with Mad Decent, T & A Records, Party Like Us, Play Me Records, and Slow Roast Records.

From the moombahton that he had a heavy hand in defining, to the groovy, bass heavy, genre benders that he pumps out on the regular, this young artist is a distinct production talent in the studio and a crowd favorite in his live sets. LeDoom’s sound and selection have organically established him as an artist to watch out for, from behind the decks of DJs to the party on the dancefloor.

BIO:
"" German music producer Leon Weber ( aka. LCAW ) was born in Munich in 1994. Raised in a musical family, with a mother as a music professor at the University of Graz, LCAW began playing the piano at age two and continued to learn several other instruments like the cello and the drums soon after. All these years of music education served LCAW with a great knowledge base that led him to produce his first tracks at age 18. LCAW’s fascination with electronic music was ignited by his first club experience and the general rise of the German house music scene. Inspired by artists such as Paul Kalkbrenner, Bonobo, Parov Stelar and many more LCAW produced his first remix of British band ""Daughter"", which became an instant success on YouTube and Soundcloud. Soon after Remixes for ""Parov Stelar"" and ""London Grammar"" won over the blog community and gathered millions of streams. One of the stunning aspects of LCAW is the speed with which he’s created a large and devoted fanbase all over the world. After only 2 years in the music business his music collected more than 60 million plays with several appearances in the “Hypem” top 5 and for the past year he’s been touring the world as a DJ, and soon as an live act. First original music pieces are set to be released early 2016, so the journey is just about to start... ""

Bio:
Otto is Yotto, and Yotto is Otto.

He began his musical career at 12 years old, his brilliant young mind quickly living up to his age by creating rather fuzzy music with a piano and old synthesizer. Born and raised in Helsinki, Finland, the son of an ex-rocker, he grew up in a house full of far better tunes, ranging from blues, to classic rock, to disco. With the blessings of the gods, something rather awful would soon enough turn into Something Good.

His personal tastes developed by digging through music at the public library, drawing those crucial first inspirations from legendary acts like Moby, Orbital and The Chemical Brothers. As he grew, skateboard culture drew him into harder rock acts Iron Maiden and Manic Street Preachers. Dance music began with Royksopp, which led to a love of the early progressive trance and house pioneers like Sasha, John Digweed, System F/Ferry Corsten, Way Out West and Chicane.

10 years ago, Otto discovered FL Studio. Over the next decade he went to school and made music with friends, all while developing a deeper knowledge of house music through pioneers like Kevin Saunderson, Kerri Chandler, Toddy Terry, Cajmere, Masters At Work and Ian Pooley. Originally noticed by Above & Beyond and Anjunadeep through his work on his Something Good alias, eventually he struck up a friendship with Pierce Fulton, which led to a remix of the huge hit “Kuaga” that was released on CR2 Records at the end of 2014.

Yotto started releasing with Anjuna in June of 2015 with the tracks Azzurro and Memento, the tunes garnered support from a range of stars, from Gorgon City to Tiesto. Since then he has remixed Above & Beyond's “Counting Down The Days,” while continuing to release on Anjunadeep with his acclaimed ‘Wondering’ EP picking up support from BBC Radio 1, SiriusXM and from tastemaker DJs like Lane 8, The Magician and Kidnap Kid. Yotto's ability to cross genres and labels is what sets him apart as an artist, his diversity and refusal to be defined is what makes him one of the most appealing new artists in dance music.

His last release of 2015, ""Personal Space,"" was selected by Pete Tong as his Essential New Tune on November 20th. The accompanying track ""Mulholland 99"" was also featured on Tong's Radio 1 show. The tracks received support from a truly eclectic selection of renowned names, including Carl Craig, Danny Tenaglia, Dusky, Kidnap Kid, Lane 8 and Tensnake. 

Kicking off 2016, he's starting the year with two huge remixes. First, a banging rework of RÜFÜS “Like An Animal, which was featured by Pete Tong (yet again) as Essential New Tune on his BBC Radio 1 show. Most recently, a remix of Coldplay's massive hit ""Adventure of a Lifetime.""

Music describes exactly what words can never achieve. The exploration of sound and the emotion of music characterise exactly what Pete Oak is all about. A simple desire to let his music speak a thousand words. Starting out his career with soft and emotional productions, Pete has moved forward and progressed his style into an underground oriented sound that revolves around hypnotic melodies and driving grooves. Getting lost in the atmosphere of sound and music is the main philosophy behind his productions.

Pete has released originals as well as remixes on respected labels such as Stil Vor Talent, Toolroom, Sincopat, Eskimo Recordings, Steyoyoke etc. Pete's tracks has also frequently been aired by Pete Tong on BBC radio 1 and gained massive support from some of the biggest artist in the underground scene. 
From Pete's first release in late 2012 things has progressed really fast. He has already been dj'ing all over the world. New York, Miami, Johannesburg, London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Moscow are just a few of the cities Pete has been playing in over the past two years. 

Recently Pete has started his own label, Blindfold Recordings, with the agenda of releasing music that defines his own personal taste. His label will not be defined by the number of famous producers. The sole purpose is to bring good underground music to the surface from all around the world. 

Let the music speak for it self!’

BIO (Spanish)

Barcelonés nacido en los 80 y con más de 15 años de cabina a sus espaldas, actualmente es uno de los productores de música electrónica con más proyección en la escena musical de nuestro país. En el 2009 fichó como residente en el mítico club fragatino Florida 135 y Monegros Desert Festival. A principios del 2011 entró a formar parte del rooster de residentes de Elrow, con residencia en Space Ibiza y realizando tours por todo el mundo con sus conocidos espectáculos bajo la marca “El Row On The Road”. A finales del 2014 Raúl decidió dar un giro a su carrera y por decisión propia dejó de trabajar con la marca Elrow para poder así centrarse en su carrera en solitario. Actualmente, los espectadores pueden disfrutas de sus sesiones llenas de energía, contundencia y buen groove por toda Europa y América.

Desde que lanzó su primer vinilo en el 2005, durante estos últimos años Raúl ha ido evolucionando, perfeccionando y depurando su estilo y su sonido. Esto ha contribuido a que tenga reconocidas producciones, contando con más de 400 tracks en el mercado editados en sellos tan importantes como Suara, Toolroom, Octopus, Bitten, 1605, entre otros. Con su renombrado nombre sus tracks suelen entrar en las listas de ventas top10 mundiales de páginas tan reconocidas como Beatport.

Bio.
Music brings together. From the beginning, Enrico from Kollektiv KlangGut was absolutely sure about that. Since his early youth, Enrico has a close passion for electronic music and everything related to it. Anyone who has experienced him once on stage knows exactly, that he doesn´t only loves music but he lives it. When it comes to getting the crowd crazy about his crisp beats and phat basslines, he draws on his unlimited potential. And that´s plentiful. He has his own, exceptionally sound. This varies between Tech-House and Deep-House and is always up to date. Through his special sound, he has played himself into the hearts and the dancing feet of the enthusiasts of electronic music.",5398,47,https://www.facebook.com/KLKGMusic,https://www.facebook.com/KLKGMusic,https://twitter.com/KollKlangGut,http://www.youtube.com/user/KollektivKlangGut?feature=mhee,,4,enno@urst-agency.dehendrik@hijack-booking.de

The cross-pollination of bass music and the revitalisation of techno and house in recent years has radically transformed the broader spectrum of dance music; rendered anew by a fresh batch of new producers with uninhibited perspectives on the music’s history and its future. Belgian producer Locked Groove (aka Tim Van de Meutter) is one such deacon of dance music’s next generation; swiftly appropriating and innovating his way through the historical annals of techno and house with true flair and club-ready conviction.
Whether flirting with big room, one-strobe-light Berghain techno or visceral deep house – Locked Groove’s rambunctious take on soulful rhythm is wholly unique and versatile. His deeply personal sonic ideology opens up a vast emotional trajectory for him to explore as a producer, and his natural, flawless command of complex rhythms makes a strong argument towards his blatant potential as a decade-defining artist. His tunes already bear the foreshowing of a veteran in the field, even at this early phase of his artistic career.
What’s most surprising is that it was only in early 2011 that this 24 year old producer found himself starting to develop his own explosive hybrid of industrial techno and melancholic deep house with rapid pace.
Scouted by bass music impresario Scuba for the inclusion of ‘Drowning’ on his recent contribution to the DJ Kick’s series and for a forthcoming debut release on Hotflush Recordings, Locked Groove has quietly but confidently begun weaving his way into the collective consciousness. This growing anticipation has also seen Locked Groove sign onboard with Tiga’s recently reconfigured label, Turbo Recordings, where his work will no doubt add an experimental tension to a lengthy catalogue that boasts luminaries such as Boys Noize, Gesaffelstein, Proxy, Azari &amp; III and Chromeo.
With these two bastions of dance music already on his side, it’s surely reasonable to say that 2012 could just well be Locked Groove’s year.",16813,10,http://www.facebook.com/lockedgroove,http://www.facebook.com/lockedgroove,https://twitter.com/_LockedGroove,,,3,james@sweatlodgeagency.com

Please don't send PROMOS and DEMOS to me via Soundcloud.

Stephan Hinz is the name that for years, while remaining fairly enigmatic, has been in heavy rotation by most of the biggest and brightest underground DJ's today. Not only has he played host to these same characters with his world renowned ""DASDING Plattenleger"" radio show, but he has consistently released big tunes in those same years on labels such as Kling Klong and Renaissance. In early 2014 he joined Pan-Pot's esteemed new Second State label and put out one of the biggest tunes of the year; ""Doch"" which found its way into just about everyone's sets as well as landing on a number of highly regarded mix series including Joseph Capriati's Fabric Mix. Most recently, Stephan has joined the catalog of heavyweight labels of both Adam Beyer's Drumcode and Carl Cox's Intec securing him a legitimate rank among the worlds elite techno artists. After more than a decade of high level contributions to the world of underground dance music, now is the time Stephan steps out of the shadows to unveil his creative vision as a unique and powerful storyteller. Whether it's a long, anecdotal DJ set or an explosive, concise live performance, Stephan Hinz is a master at the controls and a orchestral raconteur of the highest caliber.",10076,81,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephan-Hinz/111944449507,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephan-Hinz/111944449507,https://twitter.com/stephanhinzlive,,"http://www.stephanhinz.de

“The one thing I knew was that I wanted this record to be a trip. When I go out, I want to give myself up to music. That was the idea for the album.”

If the main motivation whilst making Drone Logic was to take the listener on a hi-fidelity trip for the duration of his debut album, then Daniel Avery emphatically succeeded. From Water Jump’s hypnotic pulse and punch through to the crystalline click of closer Knowing We’ll Be Here via the title track’s elemental acid swirl and New Energy’s take on Neon Lights relocated to a post-midnight cab ride through London, Avery’s debut pushed and pulled at the senses and blurred the boundaries between dancefloor and home listening experience. Released on Erol Alkan's wildly psychedelic Phantasy label, reviews were unanimous in praise: ""A mesmerising debut"" (Mixmag); ""In a league of its own"" (NME); ""Exceptional"" (The Times); ""One of the finest techno albums of the year"" (The Quietus); ""Underground dance music with this much ambition hasn't been heard in quite a while"" (Resident Advisor); ""Avery owns this space"" (Pitchfork); ""A benchmark for so many other dance albums to aspire to"" (Dummy). 

Its success has been furthered by the fact that Drone Logic doesn't really fit expected templates of what a dance record today should sound like. There are no set piece vocals; when voices emerge on tracks, they are invariably disembodied, odd. And as distortion whips across techno-based backing tracks, it splices modern club music with the kind of sounds that forward thinking guitar bands might conjure up. The result is wholly compelling, gloriously transcendent and one that immediately struck a chord with club DJs, from heads of state to the best of the new class.

Coming off the back of his massively lauded FABRICLIVE 66 compilation, many of Drone Logic's first steps took place from the DJ booth out onto the dancefloor of that very London clubbing institution. Whilst Avery claims that his music is affected by every stop on a relentless tour schedule, one that earned him 32nd position in Resident Advisor’s DJs of 2014 poll, his debut was a record very much conceived in fabric. It seems natural, therefore, for his residency to be taken one step further with Divided Love, a quarterly curated night:

""fabric is my home and I'm proud to be a resident; the club has been with me from the beginning. Divided Love is about presenting acts who are doing something special…sonic souls, faith affirmers, music for the mind…""

The night, now expanding across Europe and beyond, can be seen as a direct extension of Avery's new radio show on another of the capital's underground mainstays, Rinse FM. A chance to push mind-expanding sounds from a myriad of places beyond straightforward club music, it is another platform for Avery to “bring this music together. Something is happening at the moment.”


Culminating the cycle of Drone Logic, and as he begins work on his sophomore record, Daniel Avery expands on his wide reaching world with a carefully curated album of remixes from the artists with whom Avery’s forward facing electronic style shares the deepest affinity. New Energy [Collected Remixes] is an album featuring reworks from Rødhåd to KiNK, Factory Floor to Powell, Silent Servant to Roman Flügel, Perc to Beyond The Wizard’s Sleeve and stands as a testament to the strength of the current state of affairs in electronic music, borne out of one of its most original talents.

Whatever happens next for Avery…that's going to be the real trip.

Monika Kruse,House,Monika Kruse,http://soundcloud.com/monikakruse,ian@safehousemanagement.com,"Clubbing was in its infancy when Berlin-born Monika Kruse began her first residency at the Babalu bar in Munich, where she grew up. Classically trained in piano from the age of four, Monika has always had a love of music and her early sets spanned hip hop, funk, soul and early deep and vocal house. This new breed of electronic music seized Monika’s soul and imagination. Dance music was in its infancy and since there were few clubs where you could play techno she threw her own parties in illegal venues ranging from World War II bunkers to trams to empty houses. Fortunately the police were a little behind the musical curve… “I had some funny experiences,” she recalls, “But nice ones! They stopped us once in a tram because they thought the smoke machine was a fire!” On another occasion, they came and asked her to turn down the bass so the house they were playing in wouldn’t crumble. “Luckily, they didn’t have a clue about techno!” 
	
Monika Kruse's star is shining brighter than ever with a global fan-base hungry for her irresistible beats. In 2014 her club appearances included Space Ibiza with Carl Cox, Amnesia Ibiza with Marco Carola, We Love... at Space Ibiza, Sankeys Ibiza, Egg London and regular sets for her residency at Berghain Berlin.

She dazzled the festivals, too, playing events such as Time Warp, Melt Festival, 18 Hour Festival, Eastern Electrics UK, Ultra Music Festival in Miami and South America, Sonus Croatia, Awakenings ADE, and SEMF Stuttgart. She also hosted a stage at Amsterdam's Edit Festival, showcasing some of her favourite artists such as Pig & Dan, Nick Curly and Miss Kittin.
Classically trained in piano, Monika's love of music is broad and deep. She grew up buying records, accumulating a music collection that grew to span funk, soul, hip hop, and house music. When the revolutionary rhythms coming out of Chicago and Detroit captured her imagination it led her to throw parties in illegal venues including World War II bunkers, trams and empty houses.

Electronic music culture has evolved rapidly since those early days but Monika's talent and passion is constant. “My ethos is ‘sweat with a smile,’” she says. “I give love to my audience and they give it back. LOVE – it’s the best thing in the world. My aim is to help people forget whatever is going on in their life and have a little holiday – just get lost in my music.”
Monika is also an active producer. Her Terminal M label celebrates its 15th anniversary in 2015 and she chalked up hits this year with Pig & Dan collaboration 'Soulstice', a Beatport Top 10 techno anthem. The fantastic remix package of 'Summer Drops' was also a Beatport chart favourite, featuring Monika's track reworked by Nicole Moudaber, Uner, and Mendo. With just two releases Monika was one of Beatport's Top 100 techno artists for 2014. Look out for the special re-release of the album Monika Kruse @ Voodooamt 'Passengers' in celebration of Terminal M's 15th birthday.

Monika’s passion for spreading the love extends beyond the dancefloor, too. In 2000 she founded a charity called No Historical Backspin to fight racism and homophobia. “It’s sad and ridiculous that people still get beat up, or in some countries even killed, for being gay. Or get treated badly because of their skin colour, or gender, or because they’re a refugee” she says. “But it happens. Sharing and caring is the only way to make the world a safe place for everyone. It is important for DJs to show they respect everyone.” She is currently organising a No Historical Backspin party at Berghain. Funds raised will go to Amadeu Antonio Stiftung, which supports victims of hate-crimes and campaigns against right-wing extremism.
Her charity work, like her DJing and production, is an expression of Monika’s faith in the transforming power of music. “It was my first love,” she says. “Music was my best friend. It never let me down. In good times music was there and in bad times music was there.”

Art In Motion is the alter-ego of Brazillian producer Vicente Amadeo who has taken on this moniker as an outlet to explore the more intricate, emotional side of his musical psyche. His debut Art in Motion productions have appeared on NYC-based imprint Stranjjur and on Berlin-based Mother recordings. Art In Motion has made an instant impact on a global scale, after his original composition and remixes for the young imprints landed in the crates of world-renowned DJs such as Lee Burridge, Nic Fanciulli, H.O.S.H., Robert James, Gorge, My Favorite Robot, Louie Fresco, Joyce Muniz, Phonique and a few more.

While to the outside eye it may appear as though Art in Motion suddenly landed onto the scene out of nowhere, this apparent fast track to success didn't occur overnight. Amadeo has flown the world over on his quest for success. Travels which eventually earned him a diploma from the SAE Institute in Byron Bay Australia in 2009. All of this occurred before he made his return to his home in Rio de Janeiro to form his own label, Plano B Records. The imprint has been home to some of Brazil's best house producers over it's first 20 successful releases and continues to grow. Moving forward, Vicente will continue to release his more melodic, soul-clenching compositions under the Art in Motion moniker, while his more tech-fueled beats will infect dance floors via his alter-ego guise, Amadeo.

Be tuned for this modern deep sexy music for the discerning music lover and dance floor!

At the core of every good night, the heart of your best memories, is losing yourself to rhythm and leaving your everyday troubles behind. When you immerse yourself by joining the crowd in a singular moment that no-one can take from you. 

Much like every DJ worth their salt Mark Jenkyns was sucked into the lifestyle as soon as he experienced it in its purest form. Ibiza has a reputation for sparking the inner DJ in all who encounter it’s undeniable charm, causing hobbyists to step up their game in the hopes of chasing the dream. Out of the countless thousands that make the attempt only the finest talent rises to the top. 

Now with an on-going residency for Paradise at DC10 Mark Jenkyns is officially regarded as a part of the underground elite. By upholding a high standard on every production and performance he’s carving his name into the clubland consciousness. 

Whether alone or as part of his sister project with Christopher Sylvester, Mark Jenkyns is as committed to studio time as he is the club. Constantly tweaking and perfecting his records to ensure they get bodies moving everywhere from the main room to the after party.

Although the idea of providing a good time seems simple on the surface, it’s those that want to do everything to make it happen, to its full potential, that will keep the floor full and the party at its peak. That level of dedication guarantees that when Mark Jenkyns wants the club to go off, it’s a safe bet that it will.",7429,43,https://www.facebook.com/markjenkynsmusic,https://www.facebook.com/markjenkynsmusic,https://twitter.com/mark_jenkyns,,,14,luke@nge-booking.com

70s rock, 30s swing, hiphop, triphop, pop, jazz, soul, classical music are as many shades N’to can use to colour his tracks. However it is through electronic music that he expresses and fulfills himself completely. He creates a distinctive, pure and « pointilliste » sound that already makes him a key player on the French techno market. He works every inch of his generous rhythmic, he deconstructs the sounds, betrays our habits and yet those melodies of his go straight to the point and far beyond our expectations.
Creating Hungry Music label alongside with his friends Worakls and Joachim Pastor is a chance for him to let his imagination and musical eclectism flow freely so that he continuously reinvents himself. That’s how appeared his latest project, N’to Perc Live 2015, illustration of this blurring of the borders between electronic and acoustic.",85633,51,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nto/50860802143,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nto/50860802143,http://twitter.com/#!/ntohungry,http://www.youtube.com/user/NtoTunes,"http://www.hungrymusic.fr

 - BIOGRAPHY -
Ran Salman started his career as a musician years ago and in 2008 released his first album ‘Lucid Dreaming’. Producing under the alias ‘Eastern Spirit‘ he was originally creating world/chill out style music and as one half of a duo, received much support in this genre. After this phase in his career, Ran evolved and opted for a solo career as a DJ and producer. His sound was influenced by a broad range of electronic music styles which included house, deep house, techno and disco. Pretty soon, Ran found himself expressing his thoughts and emotions through instruments such as analog synthesizers, drum machines, bass guitar and even his own voice. Ran’s music spectrum is very broad. It can span from emotionally deep spacey melodies, (the kind that make you want to close your eyes and fly on the dance floor), to a more techy, edgier sounding vibe. Over the years, Ran has gained huge support from the likes of Agents of Time,Fur Coat, Marc Romboy, Stephan Bodzin, Chris Liebing, Sébastien Léger, Hernan Cattaneo,Nick Warren and more. In 2014 Ran officaily joined to the successful Berlin based label Steyoyoke, with his ‘Fractured Memories’ EP. Consisting of remixes from two music maestros Patrick Podage and Soul Button, it also reveals his own wistful vocals and been releasing consistently under Steyoyoke or Steyoyoke Black labels since then.
His current focus has turned towards performing astounding live show with only his productions, combining top of the line controllers, drum machines and synthesizers, checkout the tour dates see where Ran is playing live next.

PRESS: Sónia Ramos: soniaramos@match-attack.com



Xinobi is Bruno Cardoso a Portuguese grown-up-kid obsessed with music. He’s part of a generation that grew up within the music-blog eruption fueled by Do It Yourself ethics. 
His influences are as diverse as his record collection consequently his productions are eclectic and self-freshened as it’s not easy not to get surprised every time he releases something. Although you can simply label it as Disco or House, the truth is that there is a unique watermark on his sound. That versatility is also visible in his performances. You can travel from fresh-funk to a deeper mood without losing consistency as he can soundtrack from Miami palm-trees to Berlin cold nights; and everything in between. 
After releasing the ep “The Best Of Me” (on Kris Menace label Work It Baby) he gained a real recognition among more established and well-known artists and opinion-makers, and his underground cult become more ample. The title song was even categorized as the “Stardust” of 2011 on Buzz-charts. Fun-fact. (I Hate The Sound of) Guitars, his last single, retained a big recognition due to both its idiosyncrasy and video. 
Together with his friends and work-partners Moullinex and Mr. Mitsuhirato he gave birth to the still-growing-influent Discotexas, a Record Label which is getting more and more followers and admirers and is stepping further to a respectable dimension of scene-credibility.",30692,384,http://www.facebook.com/xinobimusic,http://www.facebook.com/xinobimusic,http://www.twitter.com/xinobimusic,,"http://www.xinobimusic.com

tarabrooksmusic,House,Tara Brooks,http://soundcloud.com/tarabrooksmusic,gunita@listedbookings.com,"""Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent.""
-Victor Hugo

There is a line where the dark fuses with the light, the surreal with the sublime, the graceful with the powerful; it is within this line that Tara Brooks has carved out her truly distinct sound. Whether playing at an intimate club, a packed festival or a magical sunrise deep in the Burning Man Playa, Tara's music envelopes the crowd, stirring them with deep grooves, hypnotic rhythms and haunting melodies. Behind the decks, her passion and love for music is contagious.

When she's not touring, you can find Tara locked in the studio. Rather then focusing on genre or style, Tara is sonically inspired by personal experience and connection with her environment. Always striving to translate a specific feeling or moment, Tara creates a sound that is all her own: Compelling, sophisticated, haunting and healing, piercing your heart and invigorating your soul.  

Whether it's through production or playing, Tara's continued passion for sharing her music knows no bounds. From being Desert Hearts and Subtract Music's newest resident to kicking of the new year with Louie Fresco's MEXA Records BPM party and Costa Rica's Envision Festival along with several productions and remixes being set for release the future is filled with light for Tara Brooks as she continues to do what she loves her way and always from the heart.

KRINK,House,Philipp Krink,http://soundcloud.com/krink,julia@ursl-records.com,"Booking: julia@ursl-records.com
Promos:  itskrink@gmail.com

Sometimes it’s our second name that becomes the one for which we’re known. This is true for Philipp Krink, whose surname and moniker as an electronic artist has seen him travelling the globe with his sets of clean, deep grooves and melancholy colours.

Unlike many DJ’s and producers who find inspiration from inside the clubs, it was the opposite for Krink, whose first entry into those clubs came from his music. This happened after his teenage years were spent experimenting with machines, leading him to stumble into a life of sharing those ideas in sound with others - something that continues to humble him no matter where he happens to be.

He moves with his music, letting it carry him to the next point. He uses these changing spaces around him to define the details of his sound - details which have clear purpose within the clean rhythms and unfolding moods he has come to champion. This is house music that’s neither tangled up or become lost along the way.

As a traveller, a mood maker and a thoughtful young producer, Krink is a modern example of what new voices have to say; and as he throws his music into the world, it’s clear that we’ll keep trying to catch it.

SUMMIT SESSIONS IS A 2 HOUR SHOW AND AIRS WEEKLY

In 2011 Brian Bacchus started Summit Sessions at the request of a friend for a monthly mix.  At the time the show circulated around just a few dozen people at best.

Fast forward to 2015 and the show had grown to a 2 hour long weekly spot, syndicated across multiple great internet radio stations.  Through internet broadcasts, this profile, RSS, and other social media, Summit Sessions now reaches out to more than 75,000 listeners per week!

The success of the show can be attributed to the incredible quality of the guests- both Brian's local St. Louis friends to international touring household names- Summit Sessions is always about delivering exceptional, meaningful music.

Of course, this didn't all begin in 2011.  Brian has been DJing since 1999 with residences at large venues in San Francisco, the UK, Omaha, and Las Vegas.",7224,175,http://www.facebook.com/DJBrianBacchusKC,http://www.facebook.com/DJBrianBacchusKC,https://twitter.com/DJBrianBacchus,,"http://www.mixcloud.com/BrianBacchus

adeline,House,Adeline,http://soundcloud.com/adeline,booking@adelinemusic.com,"All booking at booking@adelinemusic.com Thanks!

Adeline is a producer and vocalist with a unique style that has won her fans across the globe. She’s a diminutive figure punching well above her weight in the DJ booth and studio and always manages to have crowds in the palm of her hand. Brought up in the rolling Swedish countryside, Adeline couldn’t resist the allure of the underground club scene in Stockholm and with countrywoman La Fleur started performing as Housewives. Before long she was presenting on Scandinavia’s biggest radio show as well as working as a curator for SoundCloud.

In recent years she has spent time in New York, Milan and Berlin and then landed in London before moving to Ibiza where she secured her own residency at Pacha’s Destino venue as well as Tox, playing alongside the likes of AudioFly, DJ Tennis and Blond:ish. Never far from radio, Adeline also hosts her own show on Pulse and has interviewed the likes of Cassy, Ryan Crosson and tINI as a result. With a strong sense of self and an ability to lay down hypnotizing chords and wobbly bass next to magic melodies, Adeline’s own playful vocals are the icing on the cake. Her first releases were snapped up by established labels like Get Physical’s Kindisch and climbed up the Beatport charts, staying in the Top 20 for three weeks. More material followed on LA’s Culprit label and London’s Resonance Records, as did gigs at Sonar and Eastern Electrics and collaborations with No Regular Play’s Greg Paulus. Recently she has spent time crafting new records including a couple of remixes. Now that Adeline has established herself, she continues to confound expectation and is a rightfully respected modern talent.

Benelux - jair@clickagencyamsterdam.com

After years of producing music under various guises, Jon Charnis found his true calling in the slower, darker, and deeper spheres of House music. The re-invention manifested beyond music as the former DC native relocated to the city of Los Angeles while launching his new moniker (his actual birth name). From then on it didn't take long for him to make an impression. His track 'Prophecy' was spotted by Innervisions boss Dixon, who signed the track to his prestigious Berlin based label after road testing it at some of the world's premier parties. He followed this up with an official remix of Art Department's Burning Man anthem, ‘Robot Heart’ on No.19 records. The streak continued with releases on more top labels including Supernature, All Day I Dream, and Leftroom Records.

As a DJ, Jon Charnis' international profile has risen just as quickly. With gigs at Space, Ibiza and Sonar, Barcelona already under his belt, 2013 saw Jon playing across the globe at other hotspots in Berlin, Munich, London, and Amsterdam. This will be a year to watch for the fast rising DJ and Producer .

Jon Charnis has received support by world renowned DJs such as Art Department, Dixon, Tale of Us,  DJ Tennis, Audiofly, Thugfucker, Steve Lawler, Audiofly, and Anja Shneider, to name a few.

Wer diese Weisheit zu verantworten hat, weiß man nicht, sie könnte aber von Herrn Fuchs und Frau Elster sein. Alltag schön und gut, aber diese beiden haben nur eines im Sinn: dein inneres Kind herauskitzeln. Eine Nacht mit Fuchs und Elster heißt den Ernst des Lebens hinter sich lassen. Staunen, Freundschaft, Träumerei. Und ganz viel Zauber durch feine Musik - mal böser Wolf, mal zarte Libelle.

Promo's, requests & Info: rodgmusic@gmail.com

In a world jam-packed with one-hit-wonders, extremely consistent Dance producers have always been sought after. And that makes Rodg one of the rare-breed. The humble Dutchman is one of the best kept Armada Music secrets, delivering top notch releases of unwavering quality on a regular basis.
 
An impressive string of features on various Armada compilations proved to be the stepping stone for Rodg’s versatile and exhaustive sound, long defining the renowned chill-out vibe and portraying baffling interpretations of the sound of summer. However, even a quick glance at his discography reveals that there is more to him than meets the eye.
 
Rodg reached the coveted #1 position on the Beatport Chill-Out Charts with ‘Jaqueline’, carving the way for an ever-increasing number of state-of-the-art records to follow up on previous mind-blowing compositions. Through game-changing collaborations (e.g. with Patrick Baker) and solid remixes for huge artists (e.g. Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Solid Stone, Cosmic Gate, Ruben de Ronde), Rodg works his way up the old fashioned way: through extensive support of the whole gamut of top-tier performers, including Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Max Graham, Cosmic Gate, Markus Schulz, and Ruben de Ronde.
 
The Rodg sound has become inseparable from Armin van Buuren’s warm-up atmosphere, leading to unforgettable performances at A State Of Trance shows in Utrecht, Ibiza, and Mexico, Armada Nights, and his signing to Armada Bookings. He is responsible for one of the six sublime mixes on the A State Of Trance Festival 2015 compilation, the work-horse of the Armada family and a mainstay on countless worldwide Dance compilations. He is the present and the future of Electronic Dance Music, yet seemingly always underrated.

Hailing originally from Venezuela, and now based in Barcelona, Fur Coat’s story is one of passion for techno and electronic music. It’s a tale of deep, dark driven beats and rolling grooves that both encapsulates the mind and moves the feet. It was this love of music that by chance in 2004 brought Sergio Munoz and Israel Sunshine together and led to a musical intertwining which would drape itself royally over the shoulders of the music industry. 

In 2010 Crosstown Rebels founder Damian Lazarus unearthed Fur Coat and promptly signed and released their highly anticipated debut EP “Space Ballad”. However It would be their release ‘You and I’ featuring vocals from Cari Golden in 2012 that would put the name Fur Coat on the tongue of weekend warriors across the universe. ‘You and I’ became an anthem globally and added fuel to the Fur Coat fire that was blazing bright. Showing no sign of dowsing that fire throughout 2012 they provided remixes for uber cool labels such as Culprit, Get Physical and My Favorite Robot, and played at some of the finest venues across the world including Warehouse Project (Manchester), DC-10 (Ibiza), Day Zero (Mexico), Verboten (New York) plus many more. As 2012 drew to a close, the pair released their debut album ‘Mind Over Matter’ on Crosstown Rebels once more. The album was a smooth blend of club bombs and downtempo grooves which received rave reviews. This was the perfect way to end a landmark year, propelling Fur Coat through 2013 with a jam packed DJ and production diary.

A successful album is a hard act to follow, but Fur Coat managed to traverse this rocky path with consummate ease. 2014 was another landmark year as the guys released their first original material since Mind Over Matter. 'Theres No Time EP' came out on the much hyped Hot Creations imprint from Jamie Jones & Lee Foss, while the ‘U Turn EP’ went out on Damian Lazarus’s Crosstown Rebel and is still getting hammered by some of the biggest players in the game today. Hot on the heals came 'The Right Move EP' for Ellen Allien's legendary Berlin imprint Bpitch Control, and featured the vocal talents of Jaw from DOP, again cementing Fur Coat’s name at the top of the industry. 

The rise of Fur Coat showing no sign of stopping, 2015 was a year of highly anticipated events such as their return on Crosstown Rebels with their ‘Berlin Chronicles EP’, another highlight was their debut on Sasha’s hot label Last Night On Earth with the ‘Katarsis EP’. If that wasn’t enough, Fur Coat made their acclaimed debut on the globally renowned BBC1’s Essential Mix and the highly esteemed Balance series, while completing over a 100 dates around the globe.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. May will see their much anticipated return to Crosstown Rebels as they release a killer 2 track EP that you are already hearing across dance floors globally. 2016 already looks like it’s set to be Fur Coat busiest year to date.",45622,235,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fur-Coat/201228743228492,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fur-Coat/201228743228492,http://twitter.com/furcoatmusic,http://www.youtube.com/FurCoatOfficial,"http://www.furcoatmusic.com/

Egothermia Recordings has been founded in the year 2012. Ruiz Sierra has initiated Egothermia Recordings in order to complete the Egothermia platform as a supporting tool for young artists in Electronic Music. The label philosophy is as simple as demanding: helping young producers and DJs to release their music without depending on Major Label structures. The releases can mainly be assigned to the genres Techno and House.

Designed as unique integral researching platform for studio sound experimenting, stage performances and multimedia presentation of new sonic structures, the Egothermia Records also appears in a form of a music label. Its whole purpose is to support the artists in spreading their creative output in the both music universes, analog and digital one. This label is the latest manifestation of the creative spirit caught in the notorious electronic platforms such as Techno, Tech-house, Minimal which established the alternative sound of Netherlands electronic music in the worldwide circuit. But as it is created from collective vibe, stuffed with technology, open to your mood, effective on sucking it in, this time the aim of the whole platform and its representation in the form of Label Egothermia is much courageous. It makes you feel above, between, inside - extremely you. This feeling is based on Egothermia. It helps to enjoy life. Period.
