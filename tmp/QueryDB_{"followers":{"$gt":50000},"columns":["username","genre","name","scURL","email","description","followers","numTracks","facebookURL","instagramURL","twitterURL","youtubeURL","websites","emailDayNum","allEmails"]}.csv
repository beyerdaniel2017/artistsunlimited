Management: daniel@thatsound.com.au

Snapchat: bryndodo

Brynny has fast become an important fixture on the Melbourne Bounce scene. Hailing from the Mornington Peninsula, it was only a matter of time before the wunderkind’s passion for all things music and bounce saw him venturing into the city – and once he arrived his enthusiasm and talent was on display for all to see. Brynny brings a musical understanding to the table which is impressive for his young age, and his melody-driven bounce sets have found favour with a more commercial crowd who’s not afraid to have fun; however, don’t write him off as a one trick pony. Brynny has now begun to pioneer his own inimitable kick bass sound, gathering fans across the spectrum, with his more mid-tempo, glitch hop, dubstep and complextro inspired productions having a well established cult following.
 
Calling the likes of Will Sparks, New World Sound, Mash n Kutcher and J-Trick fans of your work is no mean feat, and a definite statement to his talent which has seen him become a resident at Adelaide's HQ, Candy's in Sydney and Melbourne’s home of bounce music, Cloud Nine. The bookings have come in thick and fast, adding Stereosonic, Goodlife and many international gigs to his portfolio, including Glasgow, Indonesia & South Korea. 
 
Kicking into gear in 2016, Brynny prepares to hone in on his own sound and establish a career on a global scale. Armed with new and exciting productions, he is ready to conquer the world.

manager: dannyunited@topshelfmgmt.com

San Francisco-based producer, Antiserum, is a permanent fixture atop the cresting wave that is forward-thinking bass music. Over the years, his inventive and ever-evolving style has landed his records on many of dance music's leading imprints including OWSLA, SMOG, Firepower, and Never Say Die, in turn gaining earnest support from every heavyweight of the genre including Skrillex, Diplo, Bassnectar, RL Grime, 12th Planet, and countless others. From hip hop-inspired highlights like ""Brick Squad Anthem"" and ""Trippy"" produced with longtime collaborator, Mayhem, to the cutting edge sounds of his most recent single ""Boom"" with Tha Trickaz and Snails collab ""Wild"", Antiserum's sub-heavy output has continually pushed boundaries in bass music with voracious creativity.

As with every year, 2015 saw Antiserum bringing his electrifying sets around the globe, hitting nearly 40 cities in the US with Crizzly from January to May before touring in Australia and New Zealand over summer. After a few months locked away in the studio, Antiserum will be hitting the road once again this fall with his pal Mayhem, embarking on his first-ever headline tour where he'll premiere all of the new material he's been making this year.

Hailing from Germany, Styline is the sonic innovator that has been sending shockwaves across the electronic music spectrum with his unique brand of house music. Pioneering his own Power House genre, Styline has proven his versatility as a producer and has garnered a solid legion of followers with his innovative and dynamic productions.  

Starting out in 2009, Styline dedicated his free time to crafting high-energy filled electro and progressive house mixes, which he uploaded onto his YouTube channel. Winning listeners over with his skillful selections, he amassed over 200 million views on his channel, making a name for himself as a worldwide Internet phenomenon. Founding Arcane, the largest DJ Network on YouTube, Styline established an entirely new path for DJs and producers and the way that people access the world of electronic dance music. Taking his passion to the next level, Styline decided to take his music overseas, focusing on the burgeoning Asian electronic dance music scene, securing himself a residency at one of the most reputable nightclubs in Asia, M1NT Club Shanghai. 

Attracting music lovers to his SoundCloud with a selection of hard-hitting remixes and originals, all available for free download, Styline has spent the past 6 months developing his distinctive Power House genre. Featuring punchy basslines, groove-inducing melodies and tailored vocals, this genre has surged in popularity and has taken club music to a completely new realm. Releasing his dance floor gem ‘Rose’ in December 2015, Styline caught the attention of Spinnin’ Records, who signed the track to their SPRS imprint and released it with a fitting music video on their YouTube channel. With Styline’s massive remixes making their rounds, such as his edit of Valentino Khan’s ‘Deep Down Low’, his signature sound is infiltrating into the charts and readying the electronic music world for the future of Power House! Aside from a prolific release schedule, Styline has delivered copious amounts of energy-fuelled live shows over the past few years, further raising awareness about the remarkable artist that he is.

Garnering over 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel and over 200,000 fans on Facebook, in a short time Styline has made a colossal mark on the music world, and is just getting warmed up. With plenty more releases lined up, and an abundance of ideas ready to get put into action, Styline will not rest until he has spread his coveted sound to every corner of the globe in an emphatic manner. Gearing up to make 2016 his biggest year to date, Styline is set to perform at some of the most important dance music events this year; including Ultra Music Festival Miami, Inception At Sea alongside The Chainsmokers and Winter Music Conference shows. With a burning desire to take his prodigious sound to the next level over the course of the year, stay tuned for the next phase of Styline’s enthralling Power House takeover!",164909,24,http://facebook.com/DJStyline,http://facebook.com/DJStyline,http://twitter.com/DJStyline,http://youtube.com/c/Styline,"http://mixcloud.com/Styline

At the core of Indie Dance and Deep House music, Swiss based DJ, producer and musical maverick Nora En Pure is someone who connects dots between different and disparate sounds, styles and scenes with ease.

The vivid South African, has already proven to be quite productive, what resulted in deep and funky works of audible engineering for the label Enormous Tunes and Tokenish since 2009. The melodic but mesmerising club music has been fashioning a big and an undoubtedly dedicated fanbase.

Her Remix for Daniel Portman’s KHAWERI in 2010 got huge reactions from all global players, became   the   preferential  mix  of   the   single   and   launched   her   career as a producer. In 2011 her track YOU MAKE ME FLOAT hit Top50 of Beatport charts & made the cut onto legendary Buddha Bar Compilation. In fall 2012 she released AURELIA, which became a requested club hit and made it on various compilations. Her crossover chart hit COME WITH ME first saw lights in February 2013 and made its way up on top of Beatport charts, and remained in Top100 for over 7 months.

Keys N Krates,Indie/Alternative,,http://soundcloud.com/keysnkrates,get@keysnkrates.com,"While it may look that way on stage, nothing is ever simple with Keys N Krates. Not when everyone has an equally valid opinion, along with the willingness (no, the all-consuming need) to sit and scrutinize a hearty 808 hit or laser like synth line for hours on end.

It's been this way since the very beginning, when Keys N Krates went from being a live hip-hop band reliant on rough acapellas and memory-jogging remixes to something much more complex - a tight-knit trio of producers/performers - Turntablist Jr Flo, Keyboard player David Matisse, drummer Adam Tune - who take rocking a party as seriously as a week spent in the studio. ""We always trade roles from song to song,"" explains Jr. Flo.  ""It's not uncommon for Matisse to flip a sample, or for me to write a melody, or for Tune to chime in on the mixing of a track. It's not the fastest way of working, but everyone has a say in everything.""

Which explains why their breakthrough singles (the elastic loops and diamond-edged drums of ""Dum Dee Dum,"" the head rush hooks of ""Treat Me Right,"" a frantic, D'n'B-flavored ""Are We Faded"") are able to pull the strings of packed festival crowds without resorting to tired EDM tropes. Hip-hop, house and UK bass music all play a role in a Keys N Krates record, but so do the dark-tinged dynamics and widescreen ways of indie acts like Caribou and M83. ""Seeing M83 live at the Osheaga festival changed our whole perception of how their music translates live,"" says Jr. Flo. ""The chord progressions are beautiful and catchy but never corny. It's pop music at its best.""

That was essentially the goal with the Toronto group's new Midnite Mass EP: cuts that are calibrated for clubs but that can translate beyond. Punchy and powerful. Emotional and epic. That goes for everything from its title track (an intro that sounds like a suspenseful thesis) to a Katy B collab (""Save Me"") that'll beam old-school ravers straight back to the '90s. And then there's something as deceivingly simple as ""Love Again,"" a soulful rap beat created from scratch and such artful details as the orchestral flourishes of Ouici and the gospel vocals of a friend named JP. Let's just say it's no coincidence that the song sounds like it sampled a dust-caked '70s record from a long-buried discount bin;  That Just Blaze or Kanye might find and flip, Keys N Krates want to leave you wondering just how they do it.     

“We wanted people to wonder where we got a lot of the sounds for this EP, the same way we have when listening to producers like Just Blaze and Timbaland.  Those guys have always used source samples or sounds that leave you scratching your head.  We love that simplicity; it's like true Italian cooking, a few ingredients to make something so impactful…. beats that leave you wondering 'where the fuck did he get that sound from?'

BIO

Moon Boots entered the world in the mid-1980s via Cape Canaveral. After years of service as the preferred footwear of celebrity astronauts (notably Tom Hanks), Moon Boots came to life during a classified experiment aboard the International Space Station. Little is known of what actually transpired aboard the shuttle, but in short, Moon Boots became a sentient creature, equipped with reason, intuition, and groove. Before long, he grew tired of working for the space-military-industrial complex and found solace in the soothing sounds of underground disco and R&B boogie records. He knew it was only of matter of time before he was hung up like so many boots before him. He abandoned the program and used his savings to build a studio in an unnamed location, where he is currently working.",93399,93,http://www.facebook.com/moonbootsmusic,http://www.facebook.com/moonbootsmusic,http://www.twitter.com/moonbootsmusic,,"http://www.moonbootsmusic.com

“Support from industry heavyweights abound, The Him’s penchant for sultry remixes is on display...and the results showcase a duo whose name is ascending with every free download.” - Aaron Berecz for Dancing Astronaut

Hailing from Amsterdam, The Him is a music production duo (aka Jeroen & Steven) creating buzz with their smash hit singles, official remixes and monthly Midnight Mixtapes. Gaining inspiration from artists like Daft Punk, Duke Dumont, Empire of the Sun and The Chemical Brothers, The Him's sound is an infectious union of indie, deep house, nu disco and pop – full of fresh, experimental and sometimes tropical beats bound to make you move and wanting more.

With an exclusive premiere on Dancing Astronaut, their latest single “Feels Like Home” quickly hit #1 on SoundCloud’s Deep House chart, went viral on Spotify, claimed #4 on DMC’s Buzz chart and garnered more than 3 million plays in only one month on their SoundCloud page. The single, featuring the smooth vocals of up-and-comer Son Mieux, continues to attract international attention from magazines, bloggers and fans alike, with interviews and special mentions from EDM Sauce, Your EDM, DJ Mag NL, MrSuicideSheep, EDMTunes and countless more. Heralded as a “Dutch masterpiece” by radio 538 legend Wessel van Diepen, “Feels Like Home” is the 3rd official single from The Him, after two chart-topping collaborations with famed DJ/music producer Sam Feldt. In addition to their singles , Jeroen and Steven have also dropped official remixes for the likes of The ChainSmokers, Otto Knows, Shift K3y, Shaun Frank, Adrian Lux, Solomon Grey, and Dotan.

Their Midnight Mixtapes, featuring the latest deep house tracks - including their own - continue to grow each month. With over 60,000 avid followers on SoundCloud, amassing millions of plays, The Him is also supported and played by the some of the world’s biggest DJs including: Tiësto, Felix Jaehn, Oliver Heldens, Don Diablo, The Chainsmokers, Sam Feldt, and more. Cementing their position in the dance music scene and blossoming in their creations, The Him are most certainly artists to keep an eye on over the next year.

_________________________________________________
It's been roughly 5 years of dedicated producing and Benasis has already begun to leave his permanent footprint in the steadily growing Bass Music scene.  He's accomplished so much in such a short period of time.  After winning a highly competitive Beatport Remix Competition for Skint Records legendary music producer, ""Freq Nasty"", he broadened his following greatly.  His remix of the reggae influenced Freq Nasty track ""Not Givin In"" went on to make top 10 of the top 100 dubstep charts of Major Online Electronic Dance Music store ""Track It Down"".  He's received support from not only Skint Records Freq Nasty but also Proper Pedigrees big time Trap Duo Watapachi, heRobust, Kid Kamillion, Dirty South Joe, and Kennedy Jones. 

After Benasis gained attention from his release on Skint Records, he was approached by Konfront Records to do a four track EP entitled ""RUID"" or Rage Until I Die which also went on to do well among the masses. Soon Benasis would hold his own remix competition of his track ""Whatcha Gon Do"".  The competition itself received 30 amazing remixes created by talented music producers from all over the world. 

Benasis quickly continues to push forward with his talented and creative innovation of Bass Music.  In March 2014 he went on to win a coveted competition for top Trap Song with INDABA MUSIC for his song ""Atom Bomb ""which is now available in there licensing catalog. On December 18, 2014 Benasis took the  center stage with the win of Guitar Center's Your Next Record with Steve Aoki! Benasis was hand picked by Steve Aoki from over 7,000 entries from all over the country. This win along with his consistent drive and passion and with an ever growing fan base (over 87k followers on soundcloud) will surely make Benasis one to watch for in 2015.",89820,363,http://www.facebook.com/JULIANBENASIS,http://www.facebook.com/JULIANBENASIS,http://twitter.com/officialbenasis,https://www.youtube.com/user/DJJBENASIS,"http://www.jango.com/stations/356544109/tunein

Games Continued by Bakermat & Goldfish http://smarturl.it/gamescontinueddirty
Heart Shaped Box OUT NOW http://smarturl.it/goldfishhsb


The secret is officially out. An electronic duo from the Southern-most tip of Africa have gone from one of Dance Music’s best kept secrets to an act tipped by industry tastemakers as the band to watch this year.
Their genre-defying mix of live instruments, House beats and searing live performances has seen Goldfish go from impromtu jams at a tiny beach club in Cape Town to headlining Amsterdam’s Olympic Stadium, cracking a top 10 on the US iTunes Dance chart, a residency at Pacha Ibiza with David Guetta and DJ’s like Fedde le Grand knocking at their door to do remix their tracks. It’s almost hard to believe that not very long ago they were just Dom and Dave, two music students who lived a relatively chilled life of surfing and playing music in their home town Cape Town.

All that really did change when they decided to record an album. Not having a record deal or much money, they simply locked themselves in a bedroom...with a double bass, a saxophone and a couple of synths, recording their debut Caught In The Loop on their own. A charming dance record that received massive support from the international dance music scene, desperate for something fresh and new. Pete Tong even called it his Ibiza Poolside Album of the Summer.

The two guys quickly found themselves maintaining gruelling international tour schedule that saw them play sold-out shows from Amsterdam to Miami, from the Sydney Opera House to Sao Paulo, in-between still finding time to mix the covermount CD for DJ mag international, garnering a record-breaking 8 SAMA nominations, numerous number ones radio at home, as well as performances at Glastonbury, Sensation White, Ultra Festival Miami, 46664 and Get Loaded in the Park amongst others.

They even got their hands on a residency to die for; Friday night at Ibiza super-club Pacha. Here they developed their sound further and presented it on their second album Perceptions of Pacha. As no other album, Perceptions Of Pacha captures the carefree vibe of the magical island of Ibiza, with their track Fort Knox cracking the Top 10 on the US iTunes Dance Charts. Following that up with the SAMA award-winning album Get Busy Living featuring the smash Youtube hit video We come together that garnered millions of online views for it’s hilarious and ground breaking animation work that has become a Goldfish trademark.

With props coming from everyone from Dr Dre, Sebastian Ingrosso, Pete Tong, Sander Kleinenberg, Fedde Le Grand and Faithless, watch this space. The Re-invention of the DJ has arrived.

Hailing from the Netherlands, Bart van der Meer - known as Bart B More - has been a constant factor in the international electronic dance music scene for many years. His love for DJing and producing has taken him to every continent on the planet, leaving his audience with something to remember - or not to remember. 

Bart B More's genre-bending style has helped him to become one of the most renown and respected electronic music producers today. He steers away from a traditional production formula to help create his own signature sound: A fusion of deep techno and heart-pumping electro, with an unusual swing in the drum patterns. His eclectic mix of synths, unparalleled sonic range, hard-hitting drops, and heavy bass lines have helped him to create a distinct and original style. The ability to make each beat, synth, and drop flow seamlessly together in his sets, has made Bart a well seen guest at events all over the globe.

Bart does not discriminate against mainstream and underground music, and prefers to draw inspiration from anywhere and everywhere; ""The limitations and borders a genre can imply sometimes kills creativity in the producing process, and that's something artists deal with. I try to stay away from that mind frame, and just create how I feel."" His non-commitment to any specific genre and ever-changing tastes make each one of his shows a whole new, fresh experience: ""Every set to me is a challenge to entertain a crowd, to bring forward my musical taste but also read the crowds mood. And if that's the same thing, that's when I love what I do the most.""

In 2008, Bart found a new challenge and created his own label, Secure Recordings. Since then, the label has been an outlet for Bart to release his own music as well as share his various tastes and musical range. By starting his own label, he's able to showcase not only his own style, but also give new artists a platform to release their music. Bart is a firm believer in supporting new and up and coming artists, and by establishing Secure Recordings he's able to give them a chance to make their mark in the industry. 

In addition to his own label, Bart has had the opportunity to release many of his tracks with some of the industry's top labels including: Boys Noize, OWSLA, Relief Records, Sound Pellegrino, Fool's Gold, Trouble & Bass etc. By releasing with different labels he has been able to reach an even larger and more diverse demographic, putting him into the spotlight of many devout electronic dance music fans. 

In the future, Bart B More hopes to continue to have a role in the responsibility to keep dance music forward thinking, innovative, and open minded.

What the fuck is a Teddy Cream? 
Rewind back to 2010, two young individuals at the ripe age of 13 come together to make a one off track.. Unknowing to them this one song would set off a motion of events, and an everlasting friendship, leading to one of the hottest young duo’s to have ever risen out of the Melbourne club scene.

Today these boys go by none other than Teddy Cream. They have grown in stature since those early days and have been voted #6 best DJ act in Australia at the 2015 ITM awards in Sydney.

They have destroyed dance floors all over Australia and have started to travel the world, playing in South Korea, Indonesia, Scotland, Ireland & more.

klangkuenstler,Chill/Mainstream,,http://soundcloud.com/klangkuenstler,booking@stilvortalent.de,"booking@stilvortalent.de 

Sometimes in arts, but certainly in life and especially in the art of sound: the eye and the ear are equal partners. Talking about the young and talented KlangKuenstler, you have to add another organ of perception: the heart. Music without emotion is useless. Emotional music reminds us that we shouldn’t think about yesterday or tomorrow, what counts is solely to enjoy here and now. Music should preserve our feelings, tickle out our endorphins and – in the best case – be a joyful escapism from the hectic everyday life. Welcome to the world of KlangKuenstler!

In 2012, the 22-year-old Michael Korb choose the way from bavarian solitude to the center of hustle and bustle when he moved to germany’s capital – Berlin calling! Only a few years before, he had his first contact with electronic music. His enthusiasm was activated by his first club experience in Munich, which came along like a revelation: loud music, people are dancing, the colorful lights and smiling faces everywhere. At the age of 20 years, his passion begins to professionalize. The KlangKuenstler start digging records and was looking for new and inspiring music. No, not the common chart material thrilled him; he was seeking for fresh tunes and a home for his first productions. In 2011, he founded the label “Zuckerton Records” to release his music and give other artists with a unique style a platform for their music.

His music is warm, mellow, and soft; it embodies a cheerfulness that you can describe like the perfect match between romance and hedonism. On his first productions indicates that KlangKuenstler is a musing dreamer: His track “Freudentraene” was a huge milestone in his young career and with three million plays on Youtube quite a success. 

It is said that nature gives a man his abilities, and the happiness brings them into effect. Talking about the KlangKuenstler, we have to add his almost impressive talent. With releases on labels as “Stil Vor Talent”, he has created an inimitable style and his own voice, which honors his alter ego: his deep and tech house is not only in love with melodies, but passionately produced. Think of a kaleidoscope that captures a variety of different colors. Whether it's jazz, soul, funk or his great passion for pathetic sensual strings – out of several mosaics he creates a total work of art that simply sprays a positive vibe.

Although he appears as a DJ from time to time, KlangKuenstler is first and foremost a live act, which wants to introduce his own productions in the club. Here he cannot only engage spontaneously to the particular mood of the crowd, but also arrange his own tracks in an always new and appealing way. On the Berlin based label Stil vor Talent he released his single ""Barfuss auf Wolken"", which is not only a highlight of his set, but already reached 1 000 000 000 plays on Soundcloud. The track is also featured on Oliver Koletzki’s „Schneeweiß Compilation II“. 

It does not need a glimpse in the crystal ball to predict a promising future for KlangKuenstler. In 2014, his debut album „That's Me“  was released. The long player embodies his own compass – it indicates his origins, his current status as an emerging live act and suggests new directions he will follow. Whether epic chords, his fetish for grasping bass lines or these joyful melodies – „That's Me“ is a multi-faceted, atmospheric and first and last a very emotional record. It is such a heavenly sensation to follow his heart.

Kungs (pronounced « Koongs ») is a 19 years old producer from the south of France. He started his musical career with a djembe gifted by his parents to him at the age of five. From these early days Valentin could spend entire afternoons listening to Rock’n’Roll classics with his father. From The Who to The Kooks with many in-between, this essential listening forged the first steps to Kungs inspiration as an artist. 

Discovering a passion for electronic music in his teenaged years, Kungs became infused with interest for melodic sounds and crafted timbres always lead by a dominant vocal. By the age of seventeen his interests had evolved, and creating melodies using his own instruments became a passion. 

Shortly after his first experiences with a digital production software, Valentin was sharing remixes across the board of online social networks. His remix of Bob Marley - ‘Jammin’ and Lana Del Rey ft Molly - ‘West Coast’ both boast several million plays on Soundcloud & YouTube.  


After a few unofficial remixes, official remixes requests were around the corner. From Axwell & Ingrosso to Lost Frequencies, Kungs quickly became a key remixer for the other DJ producers. Kungs’s remix of « Are you with me » counts now more than 16 million views on Youtube and more than 65.000 fans are following his Soundcloud page.

Simoultaneously, his first original track “To Describe You” became available.
This collaboration with Mozambo featuring Molly instantaneously hit one million plays on Soundcloud. 

With early support slots with significant acts from many aspects of the melodic house landscape such as Kygo and Klingande, Kungs has quickly formed into a well established artist in the scene today with a tendency to provide driven and impressive production and live sets. 

In January 2016, Kungs traveled the European continent alongside David Guetta in order to ensure seven times the warm-up of his Listen Tour.

On February 16th, Kungs released his new single "" This Girl "" melting the soul voice of the Australian band Cookin' On 3 Burners with his powerful hooks. Only a week after the release, ""This Girl"" was already charting all around Europe and keep growing every day.
Other original tracks are around the corner so you better stay tuned.",68964,51,https://www.facebook.com/Kungsmusic,https://www.facebook.com/Kungsmusic,https://twitter.com/kungsmusic,,,10,quentin@unitygroup.frquentin@unitygroup.frjazz.spinder@caa.comlaura.newton@caa.com

ILLENIUM (Official),Creative,Nicholas Miller,http://soundcloud.com/illeniumofficial,ha@illenium.com,"There are melodic bass producers, and then there is Nick Miller. The Denver-based producer known as Illenium has been turning heads in the dance music community over the past year and for good reason. Illenium has distinguished himself from the myriad of others through an unrivaled ability to create an immersive emotional experience of highs and lows that pulls on the heart strings and leaves the listener awestruck, accomplishing in the span of just a few short minutes what takes many a full set. He has displayed an adeptness for creating aural arrangements that vary in style, yet always maintain beauty, complexity and emotional depth. Illenium gave the world a taste of what he has to offer in 2014 with standout originals “Falling In,” “So Wrong,” “Make Me Do;” remixes of Dawn Golden, Odesza, Oh Wonder; and performances at Global Dance Festival, Decadence NYE and other select dates. However, as foreshadowed by his inclusion in UKF’s “Ones to Watch: 15 for 2015,” this is poised to be Illenium’s breakout year.

The Legend...

Witnessing the destruction his family had caused as the first to be infected, Apashe confronted them. There was no escaping their wrath, and so, amidst the madness in the household, Apashe reached for his grandfather’s tomahawk.  As he ferociously swung the ancient weapon at the savages, Apashe knew the flesh he cut into repeatedly was that of his own blood; his own family.  Fighting for his life, Apashe’s mind spun and anger rushed through his shaking body.  In a final spit of rage and lunacy Apashe managed to behead the last attacker; his father. Horrified and drenched in sinew he stood among the mangled remains, blood flooding at his feet.  He had managed to escape their blood-thirsty urges.  As he reached for the front door, he glanced back one last time at his dismembered family.  His father lay closest, and reaching down and taking a two-feather necklace from his father’s headless body, he made a promise to avenge whoever was responsible...

Luzcid's music is a sonic odyssey. A series of auditory adventures in which the participants completely escape time and space. He meticulously eludes genres in order to welcome a variety of enthusiasts to gather and celebrate the rewards of community. Luzcid hopes music can become platform in which the peoples of the world can reconnect and begin to restore our home to a place in which we all enjoy living.

He has already performed in almost every major US city and continues to spread his wings across the music community.Although his production stands proudly on its own ,Luzcid has proven he is one of those acts you need to experience live to get the full picture. He uses ableton live to weld a sonic quilt of sensationally hefty hip-hoppy psychedelic bass music.

Biography:
Reaching more than one million of clicks per month just on Soundcloud, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko attain massive stats for an underground artist. It must say that the Belgium duet didn't steal this success! From their recent remixes to the first appearance on Tiefblau with “Drop it Like it’s Hot, the duet sail between a Nu-Disco, Deep-House dance-floor oriented to a Melodic or Tropical House music, as a journey. Like this summer 2012 in Ibiza where Vijay & Sofia decided to create this duo.
As a couple, in life and behind the decks, Vijay & Sofia, they lead the discussion on social network and on the dance-floors since 2 years, but the career of Vijay started well before, with collaborations as the like of Camilo Franco Nico Pusch or Rodriguez Jr. Without forgetting the past, Vijay open the doors to the duet at the end of 2012.
An artist can share his life only with another artist, and that's why the duo works so well. Sofia has the soul of an artist that sticks to the skin. A well-chosen word for a tattoo artist. This graphic artist with a strong universe is also a huge fan of music and dance (More than 12 years as dancer) and Vijay led him to be with him behind the decks and software productions.
The first success of Vijay & Sofia will come from some of these free Remixes and Edits available on Soundcloud for the followers. In two year, they will remixes artists like Asaf Avidan, Daft Punk, John Newman, Kiesza, Ben Howard, 2Pac, A$AP Rocky, Duke Dumont, Gabriel Rios, Buena Vista Social Club, Queen, Nicolas Jaar , and many more…. Proof of their talent, the label of Daft Punk contacted Vijay & Sofia to release their remix of Get Lucky on Columbia in Vinyl Edition.
Except the several free download offer to their fans, the releases on major nu-disco & deep imprints are coming on Warner Music, Tonspiel, Tigers Records, Delicious Recording, Sleazy Deep, Sleazy G, Street King, Tiefblau Records, Dear Deer, Spirit Soul Records, Future Allianz, Love Style, KiezBeats and others…, and reaching several time the best sales of Beatport.
Still an eye on the future, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko will release soon an official remix for Feder, Moby, The Disco Boys, Lexer, Nico Pusch and other surprises . And if the future of electronic music will be displayed with the belgian colors?:)

Hectic has dropped a wide variety of tracks over the last few years, ranging from dubstep to garage and UK bass music. Previous releases including ''The Ripper'', ''Hard'', ''My Universe'' (featuring UK MC Janset) and ''Cyber Girl'', as well as various tracks on DJ Hatcha's label, Hatched, delivered a raw, uncut and heavy dubstep workout to the dance floors. Hectic also has an ever growing collection of remixes created for the likes of Modern Machines, The Freestylers, Adi Ulmansky, Veronika Vesper, Lindsay Mac, Them&Us, Lihot and Monkixx. He has received radio play and support from DJs on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Kiss FM, XFM, Sub FM and Reprezent Radio. This year, Hectic has set up his own label, Cover The Earth, which will aim to release forward thinking music from all realms of the spectrum. The first release on the new label will be ''Golden''. A collaboration project between Hectic and American/Australian singer and songwriter, Camille, due out in April. Setting the pace with relentless beats in a spacious and rough soundscape, it is clear that Hectic gives a new twist to multiple bass oriented genres.

Bio

Zimmer writes dreamy, modern and colorful house music. He is part of the new wave of Paris producers redefining French House, alongside Roche Musique label mates Darius, FKJ, Kartell and more. 

In the few years he’s been around, Zimmer’s made his name largely of blog-hit remixes, earning millions of plays and support across the globe. He broke out in 2014 with his remix for Danish singer MØ , clocking over 5 millions plays. His original work proves just as good: « Galapagos » is a luminous slow house gateway, while “Saturday Love” dips into night- time. True tastemaker, his religiously followed mixtape series keeps listeners in a year-round summer state of mind. 

His new EP « Coming of Age » marks his transformation into a well rounded artist ready to take it to the next level, with a more refined, minimalist sound. Recorded between Paris and Los Angeles, the EP oscillates between euphoric moments and nostalgia, seamlessly travelling between soundscapes. 

But perhaps the best way to experience the magic power of Zimmer is to see him DJ. His busy touring schedule took him all around the globe with over 80 dates in 2014, including sold out shows in NYC, SF and Paris. Coming of Age will be followed with a huge world tour that’s set to take Zimmer’s sound on festival stages and clubs alike.

With a support list including the likes of DVBBS, Yves V, Deorro, The Chainsmokers, Alvaro , Chuckie, Danny Avilla, Tommie Sunshine, Henry Fong, Will Sparks, Timmy Trumpet and countless others it's no surprise these masked party starters from Melbourne are one of the fastest rising talents to come out of Australia. With an arsenal of productions behind them the duo have had their works featured on EDM's premier main stages, from Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival to EDC and an official Q-Dance stage anthem! 

oh, all while firmly keeping their identities a closely guarded secret..

Their high energy, high impact shows see the pair blending anything from Electro, Trap & Dubstep to their signature brand of Melbourne Bounce coupled along with their loyal fans, known lovingly as the ""Masklife Nation"", have seen them propelled to #9 in the InTheMix top50 national Dj poll, being hand-picked by Sol Republic as Brand Representatives AND earning their place as National Main Stage residents of Australia's GoodLife Music Tour between the likes of Deadmau5,  Hardwell, Avicii, Afrojack, Knife Party, R3Hab, Porter Robinson and more of EDM's Royalty.

Known for their diversity; their duo's production prowess have repeatedly climbed to the top tiers of Beatport's charts,  Releasing on labels like Dim Mak, Ministry of Sound, and Onelove and taking out numerous spots in the electro house genre, an 8 month streak as #1 in the minimal Genre whilst scoring a impressive run in the hiphop charts with a top 50 placement.  

No stranger to the global stage either, these masked crusaders have already taken their electric stage presence and theatrics across the globe! With several US & Mexican shows runs already under their belt and a slew of appearances across Asia including Mongolia, Indonesia, Hong Kong & South Korea, there seems to be no end in sight for these two with their only goal being total world domination!",83193,66,http://www.facebook.com/weareslicendice,http://www.facebook.com/weareslicendice,http://twitter.com/weareslicendice,http://www.youtube.com/user/sliceanddicedj,"http://www.weareslicendice.com/

________________________________

Matt Halper and Eli Sones, the young masterminds behind Two Friends, have quickly revamped from high school bedroom producers to one of the most promising dance music duos of 2016. Known for their viral remixes of “Trap Queen”, “I Miss You” and “Cool”, the two have, in unprecedented time, mastered a wide range of genres from deep, melodic house to harder progressive cuts. With their Spotify and SoundCloud views now exceeding 17 million and with eleven #1’s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America.   

Kicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Blink 182, Tori Kelly and Alesso to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct “Soul House” style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the “Award of Independent Excellence” from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey’s hit “Born To Die” scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014. 

Following multiple performances at San Francisco’s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York’s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Denmark, Mexico and Canada, showing off their potential in the international arena.

With support now coming from the likes of The Chainsmokers, Krewella and Tritonal, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2016, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond.

Biography:

Hailing from the Eastern Europe cultural hub of Bucharest, Boehm has quickly made a name for himself in Melodic and Tropical House circles. Though only releasing music under the moniker of Boehm until relatively recently, Alex has been producing music since the age of 12 getting his start in hip-hop and eventually going on to produce several pop hits throughout Europe. Since the conception of “Boehm”, Alex has chosen to set aside all other projects and leave behind all of the accomplishments accumulated thus far. The gamble paid off. Within the last 6 months, he has had four back to back #1 Hype Machine charting songs including his remix for Benjamin Francis Leftwich’s “Won’t Back Down” which hit #1 twice, his remix of Ben Howard’s “I Forget Where We Were”, his remix of James Vincent McMorrow’s cover of “Wicked Games”, and his most recent remix of Cheat Codes' ""Visions"". The widespread appeal of his music can be found everywhere from Tiesto’s weekly podcast – Club Life Radio (where his remix for Tiesto & Martin Garrix premiered on Sirius XM) to your local Starbucks in-store playlist (where his remix of Urban Cone & Tove Lo will be integrated worldwide for the month of August). Add to that an array of musical figures who became fans including heavy weight DJ’s such as Steve Aoki, NERVO, and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike who have requested official remixes from him. As the adventure continues, Boehm is now prepping his first batch of original tunes along with a number of high profile remixes for release in the second half of 2015.",55741,64,https://www.facebook.com/BoehmOfficial,https://www.facebook.com/BoehmOfficial,https://twitter.com/BoehmOfficial,https://www.youtube.com/user/BoehmOfficial,,2,sami@deckstar.comsophie@deckstar.comferry@apa-agency.comharald@mfm-booking.de

Ookay,Chill/Mainstream,Ookay,http://soundcloud.com/ookaymusic,ben@circletalentagency.com,"One of the most impressive young leaders of the American trap scene, California-based Ookay (pronounced “okay”) exploded onto the scene when both his freshman and sophomore releases on Ultra Records charted in the top 10 on Beatport. Since then, he’s shown no sign of slowing down, working with some of the greatest producers in electronic music while developing a signature style that weaves across genres, reflecting influences as varied as Borgore, Diplo, DJ Snake, Showtek, Deorro, TJR, Boaz Van de Beatz, Valentino Kahn, Waveracer, Cashmere Cat, Lindsay Lowend, Skrillex, Lido, and Wiwek while always returning to a hard-hitting trap beat.

The producer and DJ has racked up credits and quickly made a name for himself with remixes of tracks like Congrorock’s “Bless Di Nation Ft. Sean Paul” and Steve Aoki, Chris Lake & Tujamo’s “Boneless.” Ookay teamed up with iconic producer Diplo to remix Avicii’s “You Make Me,” and his recent remix of “Kanye” by the Chainsmokers on Republic/Dim Mak Records layers his signature mix of dance music and hip-hop over fluttering pop vocals. His side project Coaster serves as an outlet for his love of alternative dance and house music, proving Ookay to be no one-trick trap pony. 

His much-anticipated spring single ""Bouncer,"" produced with the venerable Dutch duo Showtek, hit the top 3 Beatport overall chart after its March 2014 release and was a staple on summer festival stages across the country. Ookay has also quickly become known as a charismatic performer both on and off stage, appearing at venues like EDC Las Vegas, Electric Zoo, Red Rocks, and TomorrowWorld. His live shows are known for sleek transitions, sensitive song selections, and entertaining MC’ing from the booth. He’s also no slouch on Twitter, commenting on everything from the struggle to Shazam an unknown song to LA’s Korean BBQ scene. 

It’s no surprise that Ghost, out November 10 on Dim Mak Records, is one of the most exciting dance music releases of the fall. Promised to be “a blend of listening tracks as well as club bangers,” it fulfills that goal. Ghost is one of the too-rare records that will bring you from your morning commute, with the meditative “Ghost” and “Matters,” to 4 AM on the dance floor losing it to “Egg Drop Soup.” 

The Ghost Tour this fall and winter is sure to blow up dance floors across America, and truly solidify Ookay’s status as one of America’s premier young electronic artists. With support from such icons as Showtek and Diplo as well as Tiesto, Steve Aoki, Major Lazer, Borgore, Nervo, David Guetta, DJ Snake, Deorro, TJR, Krewella and more, it seems certain that Ookay’s star will only continue to rise.

Biography:

Sonic architects of songs with an emotional heft as heavy as the subwoofer rupturing basslines that underpin their work, Truth are one of New Zealand's finest creative exports. Respected across the globe, since inception several years ago, Truth (Andre Fernandez and Tristan Roake) have, as both world-class producers and party-rocking DJs, cut a clear pathway through the international dubstep scene.

On the nightclub and festival circuits, the fruits of their labor have included, several European tours, countless shows across the USA, New Zealand and Australia, an action packed South American tour, and shows in Asia.  Truth has built this performance presence through DJ support from Mala, Skream, Youngsta, Hatcha and N-Type, to name a few, giving their music an advance presence at key club nights like DMZ in London, Club Love in New York and through seminal radio stations such as BBC Radio One, Kiss Fm and Rinse FM.

Through keynote DJ support, they have been rewarded with single releases via Deep Medi Muzik, Tempa Records, Wheel and Deal, Blackbox Recs, Aquatic Lab, Disfigured Dubz, Argon and Boka Records. Through these, including critically 'The Fatman' (as released via Deep Medi Muzik) and their acclaimed Aquatic Lab released album Puppets, Truth have seen their stock rise, placing them as in-demand remixers and collaborators to The Nextmen, Miss Dynamite, Shapeshifter, The Black Seeds, Silkie, Kromestar, Tunndige,  Datsik and countless figures of note within the international dubstep community.
Acclaimed by critics both within and outside the dubstep scene, their momentum is undeniable and impossible to ignore. Face the truth or get well outta the way.

Tropkillaz is a duo formed by Brazilian producers, from the old school (DJ Zegon) and new school (Laudz).

Dj Zegon is one of Brazil’s most respected DJ/Producers – with a career spanning over 20 years, and having worked in over 100 records,including collaborations with Kanye West, M.I.A, David Byrne(Talking Heads), George Clinton,a few Wu Tang Members (RZA,Method Man,Ol’Dirty Bastard) amongst others. Former member of the group N.A.S.A, he toured the world with their debut album “The Spirit of Apollo” and performed in festivals such as Coachella.

Laudz is a new cat in the game, however even with only 5 years in the business he’s worked with the likes of like Snoop Dogg,Dr Dre, as well as Brazil’s top hip hop MCs.  The two have also scored movies,comercials and tracks for videogames .

Together, the two have created an intense collection of club bangers,that blends Trap and Bass music with Electro,Hip Hop, and Latin Samples in a unique style.

They first got worldwide attention with their underground hit “Mambo”, a sure shot in any dance-floor, and their recent collab  ”Assets” with Yellow Claw (released by Mad Decent) propelled them even further, placing Tropkillaz’s footprint in the Trap Movement.

Being recently featured on Run The Trap’s Top 10 Trap Duos (tastemaker blog in the scene – run by Complex Music), having their remix of N.A.S.A’s “Hide” on the Top 10 iTunes Electronic Charts (US & UK), official remixes for Major Lazer, and with recent support from superstar DJs like Diplo, Flosstradamus,DJ Snake,Steve Aoki, to name a few, Tropkillaz have proved to be heavy-weight contenders.

Nature sounds,Chill/Mainstream,Tai,http://soundcloud.com/nature-sounds,Tai.inoue@my.jcu,"A life long lover of nature and constantly intrigued by the natural world and the invisible world of sounds that surround us. This has taken me on a journey of trying to combine my love of exploring and documenting nature with my passion for recording and understanding sound. The idea has since manifested into a number of interesting projects and is in a constant state of evolution. I like the idea of using art as a way to understand the world of science, using imagination to explore scientific ideas beyond the limits of traditional scientific methodology.

I have built up the gear to record and capture sounds for use in films, interviews and music projects or you can check out the library of sounds. I have worked on a number of film projects in a number of different roles and enjoy working behind the camera, which has helped how I work with sound. I like being able to provide a different point of view and unique service for people who like the idea of thinking outside the box, because I live outside the box. 

The most profound sound you will ever hear, is the sound when your heart breaks open

If you like these recordings and would like more information please feel free to contact me on Tai.inoue@my.jcu.edu.au

Dreadsquad - Poland's staple Reggae Dancehall export


The Dreadsquad project has put Poland on the map for creating dancefloor friendly riddim and bassline madness. From the Superfly Studio in Lodz comes tune after tune combining Jamaican sounds of of Reggae, Dub, Dancehall, Ska and Rocksteady with the modern sounds of Breakbeat, Jungle, Dubstep and Garage.


Dreadsquad was launched during 2001 and what followed was a flurry of mashups, remixes and Polish Sound Clash victories which gave confidence to turn a passion into a way of life for the man at the controls, Marek Bogdanski. Hundreds of gigs in Poland turned into European tours and now Dreadsquad has toured as far as the USA, Canada, Brazil & India.


Always in demand, Dreadsquad has worked with plenty of top Jamaican and European artists including Ward 21, Tenor Fly, Top Cat, General Levy, U Brown, Milion Stylez, Lady Chann, Tipa Irie, Jah Mason, Perfect Giddimani, Dr Ring Ding…the list goes on.


So far Dreadsquad has released 4 mixtapes, 4 full-length producer albums and a host of vinyl and digital singles which made it into the top of the best DJ shops in Europe and into the playlists of the premier DJs of the world.

The Dreadsquad sound is a worldwide sound taking influence and inspiration from all walks of life. It is glued together by Jamaican Soundsystem culture and modern Bass music culture and is a force to be reckoned with.",278113,44,,,,,,3,"bookings@superfly.pl,adam@boomartistsagency.com"

As a producer and DJ, Jim Coles has been a significant and pioneering presence in various dance music circles for the past five years. Following a formative decade in the global hip-hop underground, Coles took the name Om Unit in the late 2000s and began to travel across genres and scenes in search of sonic tropes to cross-breed and re-imagine. Key to his approach is a desire to never settle for the destination and instead focus on what can be learned from the journey.

What drives Coles is a desire to keep challenging himself, and in turn his audience. Over the past five years, this has led him to distill various influences — hip-hop, dubstep, ambient, jungle, footwork — into a fluid take on sound system culture that sidesteps the pitfalls of genres and pastiche and creates new potentials for exploration and inspiration, with many following in his footsteps. It’s how, in the early 2010s, he came to pioneer the stylistic and rhythmic links between jungle and footwork via a series of acclaimed edits that brought him to the attention of the drum & bass scene. This personal approach has earned Coles praise as a refreshing voice in dance music from both peers and the media.

On record, Coles’ explorations into the deeper end of the electronic music spectrum have come via releases for Civil Music, including a critically acclaimed debut album, 2013’s Threads, legendary drum & bass outfit Metalheadz, where he was given access to Goldie’s personal sample archive as the inspiration for 2014’s Inversion album, Planet Mu, for a collaboration with Machinedrum as Dream Continuum, All City Records, remixing Grammy-winning producer Om’Mas Keith, Plastician’s Terrorhythm, and Exit Records, where he first collaborated with Sam Binga (leading to their BUNIT series of white label releases). The same exploratory approach has made him an in-demand remixer and BBC Radio 1, Boiler Room, Resident Advisor, FACT, XLR8R, and Rinse FM have called on him to provide mixes and showcase his sound.

In 2011, Coles set up a label, Cosmic Bridge Records, through which he has exercised an A&R sensibility that has created an exciting independent home for likeminded artists. The label’s releases, pressed onto limited edition vinyl runs, regularly sell out within days of their street date. Through Cosmic Bridge, Coles has championed veterans such as Kromestar and Boxcutter alongside new voices from Europe and America, including Moresounds, Danny Scrilla, and Graphs. The label’s breadth is best seen in the celebrated, and award-nominated,Cosmolog compilation series Coles began overseeing in 2014. Cosmic Bridge represents a dual path of inspiration: that which Coles found in others’ music, and that which others have found in his.

Coles is also a sought after DJ, with over 300 appearances in clubs and festivals in more than 30 countries he has made the equivalent of over a dozen trips round the globe and counting. And in line with his desire to imagine new potentials for dance music has appeared on varied bills from the Montreux Jazz Festival to Bass Coast, Outlook to Mysteryland.

After two decades in London, Coles relocated to Bristol in 2015. From his new studio on the English west coast he continues his search through production work (the Torchlight EP series on Cosmic Bridge) and aesthetic exercises (the Gates mix series). A keen scholar of all music, he draws from the past and present to imagine the future, never content to remain in the same place for too long.",60746,37,,,,,,12,ben@fieldartists.netMiro@surefireagency.comJerry@theoperatives.commark@civilmusic.com

Say hello         
info@deep-chills.com

Deep Chills, born in Milan as Gianmaria Sanna, started his affection with music by taking up guitar lessons at the age of 14. He quickly progressed to producing music although he originally started out producing hip hop beats, which later transgressed into EDM. It was when Deep Chills originally heard New Orleans by Naxxos when he knew he had to start producing in a genre later to be known ‘tropical house’.

He broke through in this genre in 2014 by remix tracks into very popular melodic deep house adaptations. Inspired by artists like Naxxos, Matoma & de Hofnar he reached extraordinary numbers on Soundcloud with both his remixes like You Got The Love and originals like Feelin’ Good & Lighthearted.

With remixes on Ultra Music, Universal, Ego and his first proper original releasing on Miami Beats, we can be sure to hear a lot from this Italian producer this year.

With 5 consecutive Beatport number 1s, over six million streams in the last 12 months off the back of their lively social media interaction, and collaborations and remixes for @Zomboy, @Datsik, @weareSKisM, @Excision, @Destroid, @Astronautuk, @Getterofficial and more under their belt, few can deny that Barely Alive are one of the most exciting and fastest growing bass music acts to emerge over the last year.

The duo originating from Massachusetts, USA initially made a name for themselves when they released their debut EP through @DiscipleRecordings in early 2014 to global acclaim, hitting the number one spot across 4 different genre charts on Beatport in just 24 hours. This made Barely Alive an over night success, and to this date they have been labelled just under @Skrillex as the second hottest dubstep artists of 2014 on Beatport.

International touring soon followed across the United States, Europe and the rest of the world, with Barely Alive making up one of the core artists of the Disciple Alliance tours, the Datsik Ninja Nation tour along side @Trolley-Snatcha and @KennedyJones, and multiple headline tours in Australia, New Zealand, France and more. They have received regular DJ support from acts such as @Skrillex, @Datsik, @Excision, @Far-Too-Loud and @Zomboy, as well as making regular appearances on huge online music platforms such as @UKF, @EDM, @NESTHQ, This Song Is Sick, and a guest mix for the renowned @BBC Radio 1.

This is just the start for Barely Alive, who within their first year at Disciple found themselves well on their way to becoming a future headline act.

Bio:

The Rio-based duo of Felipe “Fel” Lozinsky and Gustavo “Guk” Rozenthal, has been blowing away audiences and ears since 2007, lighting up clubs and festival with their free-for-all mix of electro, house and heavy low end. The only Brazilians to rank on DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJ poll for two consecutive years, 2011 and 2012, the duo has already conquered legions of fans, including star power names like David Guetta, Flo Rida, Black Eyed Peas, and Madonna, who have all commissioned the duo for potent remix work. The partnership with The Material Girl peaked this year when she personally selected Felguk to accompany her on her full MDNA tour of Brasil, where they performed for sold-out stadium-size audiences.

In 2010 supercharged EDM promoters Insomniac hand picked Felguk’s peaktime hit “2nite” as the theme song for the U.S.’s biggest festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, breaking records with more than 180,000 partiers. Felguk’s appeal doesn’t end there. True fans of electronic music, Felipe and Gustavo are concerned with more than just making their mark in the pop world. Recent collaborations with scene highlights like L.A. dubstep kingpin 12th Planet, Australia’s top house export Dirty South, U.K. bass fiend Example and Israel trance act Infected Mushroom prove that Felguk has its ear to the pulse of the global dance scene. 

For further convincing, you need only look to the duo’s raucous sets at Tomorrowland and Burning Man in 2012, or the full tours of Brazil, Europe and the U.S.A. that will kick off 2013. And Felguk’s future plans don’t end there. With their first official EP set for release in March of 2013, Felipe and Gustavo are ready to bring audiences the world over into the sound they have been cultivating for the past five years.

Undoubtedly, Chus and Ceballos are the most solid, professional pair of Djs/Producers from Spain. Hailed worldwide for their excellent production works, including official remixes for world-renowned artists like Madonna, they display a remarkable versatility enabling them to play in small clubs to life-size festivals. Their marathon DJ sets capture their genuine Iberican character, while their blend of styles between House and Techno lie in perfect harmony, accentuating the unmistakable beat of the percussions.
Throughout the past decade, Chus and Ceballos have been the pioneers and creators of the underground movement known as ‘Iberican Sound’. This resulted in the prologue to an important saga for artists and producers, who have chosen Tribal as their way of life. Their evolution throughout the past years has led them to the pinnacle of the global music scene.
All these years of hard work, absolute dedication, undisputed professionalism and a constant evolution in sounds have led this infallible duo to the summit of success, bringing them to securing residencies at the best clubs around the globe; Pacha New York, Space Miami, Stereo Montreal, Ageha Tokyo, and many others. Chus and Ceballos represent an invaluable legacy of sound, where their blend of styles is their dogma and the quality their message.",101629,325,http://www.facebook.com/chusceballos,http://www.facebook.com/chusceballos,http://twitter.com/chusceballos,http://www.youtube.com/chusceballosTV,"http://www.stereo-productions.com

24 year old Melbourne Dj and Producer Michael Zuidland a.k.a ‘Zoolanda’ productions are reportedly blowing party goers feet clean off and inflicting numerous accounts of fist-pumping related injuries. The heavy weight Electro come Rave producer describes his style as being “all over the joint” but many will tell you it’s the sound electro heads are wanting. Raw sawing rave synths, blended with his driving fidget inspired grooves produce a sound that’s rarely known to come out of Melbourne, let alone Australia. 

With countless originals and remixes being in the Beatport Top 100 and with many more records to be brought out it is only the beginning of what is set to be a lustrous career in music production and live performances.

Orkestrated comprise of Melbourne local heavyweights, Adam Bartas and Dean Paps. With over 15 years of dj’ing experience between them, it is little wonder why they command such a cult following across all venues they grace with their presence. 


Adam owe’s his eclectic love for music to early influences showed to him by his father, who also is no stranger to the music industry. Having being exposed to such a vast array of genres, has subsequently fine tuned Adam’s ear into hearing the best out of tracks and extracting the junk. With the help and drive from fellow partner in crime Dean Paps, Adam spun his first records in 2002. We have all been treated to the edits, bootlegs and most notably; live acapella’s, in which Adam is second to none. Adam hit his straps in 2008 where he successfully polled in the highly acclaimed inthemix awards, finishing #1 in Victoria and Number #7 in Australia. Since then he has played internationally and all across Australia, having supported many of the best including Oliver Huntemann, Phil Kieran, Audiojack and Tocadisco to name a few. Music festivals are also no feat to far for Adam, having played at Kiss My Grass, Future Music Festival and main stage at Summadayze. The clever lyrics behind Orkestrated original, ‘Nightcrawler’ can also be credited to the creative mind of Bartas. Adam’s ability to play to the right tunes at the right time is the reason behind his continued success. 


On the same side of the decks, we have the evergreen Dean Paps. Dean began his music journey at a young age, clocking up many hours of experience by spinning only the best of vinyls. The spearhead behind much of the production that comes along with Orkestrated, has seen many young up and coming producers mimic his style. “Give me a simplistic track with a solid bassline, and I’m set”, is synonymous with the quality that dean puts out in his tracks and sets. Having been part of the electronic music scene for over a decade, Dean has stood the test of time and established himself as one of the most sought after acts in Melbourne.

These two pioneers have helped create and shape the current movement of music in Melbourne that is being pushed and sought after by many dj’s of different experience and tastes from around the globe. You can catch them doing what the do best every week at clubs such as NightCrawler@Levels, Billboards, LaDiDa, Cloud 9, Room, Orange Whip, Fake Tits @ Tramp, Circus and various other venues for special appearances.

Bright Light Bright Light is the moniker of Welsh born, London based Rod Thomas who released his debut album 'Make Me Believe In Hope' last year to rave reviews. Hailed by Sunday Times Culture as ""a songwriter of extraordinary dexterity"", by Elton John as the hottest new thing in music, ending up at no.4 in the Guardian Reader's Albums of 2012 poll, and touring with Ellie Goulding, Erasure and Scissor Sisters, it's clear that hid late 80s/early 90s tinged electro-pop has found quite a few fans in the last few months.



Rod, ""the boy Robyn in all but name"" according to the NME, is performer, songwriter, producer and DJ. His debut record was put together with Boom Bip (Neon Neon), Andy Chatterley (Kylie, Nerina Pallot), The Invisible Men (Jessie J, Rita Ora, Iggy Azalea) and won the heart of journalists and fans alike since its release. Single 'Waiting For The Feeling' even brought key 90s production team Trouser Enthusiasts out of retirement for their first remix in 10 years, much to Rod's joy. A remixer himself, his Kelis and Ellie Goulding mixes, and bootlegs peppered blogs throughout 2012. He made DJ mixes for Ministry Of Sound, fashion brands, and magazines, DJd at Glastonbury, Bestival, Standon Calling, numerous Pride events, and runs successful London 90s clubnight 'Another Night' in Dalston's Vogue Fabrics.



Alongside making his own music, he's also part of Slow Knights, a musical collective formed by Del Marquis of Scissor Sisters, whose debut album 'Cosmos' came out 25th March 2013 to very strong reviews and a lot of love from Billboard Magazine. Spending some time in New York to promote the record, he's also played a string of sold-out Bright Light Bright Light shows.",69796,284,http://www.facebook.com/brightlightx2,http://www.facebook.com/brightlightx2,http://www.twitter.com/brightlightx2,http://www.youtube.com/brightlightx2,"http://www.brightlightx2.com

Valentino Khan makes everything.

From hip hop club anthems to dance music hits, Valentino's production knows no bounds. He has produced hip hop for multi-platinum and Grammy award-winning artists such as B.o.B., T.I., Bruno Mars, 2 Chainz, Iggy Azalea, Tyga and Kid Sister.

Valentino Khan has gained the support of artists like Diplo, Skrillex, Calvin Harris and many more noteworthy musicians. In 2015, he produced his original song ""Deep Down Low"" which recently was named as ""Most played track by DJ's in 2015"" by 1001 Tracklists and Sirius XM Radio's Number 1 Song of 2015 on Atomic Area.

In the summer of 2014, Valentino signed to Skrillex's OWSLA imprint for his dance music releases and released his debut EP ""In Khan We Trust."" The music video for the lead single ""Make Some Noise"" was in high circulation around the internet and MTV and was nominated as an official selection for SXSW's film festival.  Khan also has had official releases on Mad Decent, Dim Mak, Columbia, Interscope, Warner Music, Ultra Records, and Slow Roast.

Valentino has shown a unique versatility in dance music -- progressive house, techno, electro, hardstyle, trap, and more.

Additionally, in conjunction with his own headlining shows, Valentino has performed as support for Skrillex, Zedd, Flosstradamus and Carnage on their own respective tours.

Both the present and the future are bright for Khan, and he now looks to continue his success in both the dance music and production worlds.",107109,90,http://www.facebook.com/ValentinoKhan,http://www.facebook.com/ValentinoKhan,http://www.twitter.com/ValentinoKhan,http://www.youtube.com/valentinokhan,"http://www.valentinokhan.com

Multi-Platinum selling artist Timmy Trumpet is currently ranked Australia’s #1 DJ (ITM Awards 2015), averaging 10 flights a week, and juggling over 200 shows per year including major clubs and festivals around the world. His latest smash “Freaks” featuring Savage has dominated charts and radio stations in 30+ countries with over 50 million views on YouTube, making it Ministry of Sound’s highest ever selling single. 

No stranger to the limelight, Timmy Trumpet won 'Young Musician of the Year' at age 13 before being granted a full scholarship to the Conservatorium of Music, where Sydney Symphony Orchestra's Anthony Heinrich tutored him. Within two years he secured a position as the leading solo trumpet player in the Australian All-Star Stage Band, taking part in an extensive European tour covering some of the world's biggest Jazz Festivals. After developing perfect pitch at a young age, Timmy's progression into dance music has been propelled by his ability to effortlessly mix in-key whilst mastering the art of improvisation allowing a seamless transition from jazz to dance music.

""After discovering Jazz I began to jam over everything and anything, mainly stuff on the radio. It wasn't long until I discovered house music, met a DJ, and then played my first gig. I drove home that night knowing this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.""

The Live DJ/Trumpet cross-over experiment proved a great success, providing the launching pad for an acclaimed career in dance music production. Timmy now boasts a catalogue of hits including ‘The Buzz’ (Beatport #1) ‘Hipsta’ (ARIA Club #1) ‘Freaks’ (5 x Platinum) as well as a string of successes with labels like Dutch powerhouse Spinnin’ Records, Hussle and Universal Music.

Timmy’s latest collaboration with Carnage and KSHMR ‘Toca’ is due for release ahead of his upcoming US Tour. Having just returned from a recent sold-out European tour and 40+ date North American tour as well as huge successes at home, Timmy is set on bringing his captivating shows to crowds, clubs and festivals for years to come.

The UK duo, known for their beautiful production work, prolific remixing skills, obscenely vast record collections, and transcendent mixtape journeys, are being heralded as a truly unique and positive presence in today's music scenes.

""Stars Of 2012' - Mixmag

Psychemagik's first appearance on wax was an edit of Fleetwood Mac's 'Everywhere', which quickly found its way into the record bags of veterans like Tom Middleton and Greg Wilson. The duo have since released an impressive array of highly acclaimed original productions, remixes and edits. They now regularly play at major festivals, clubs and special events around the globe. Including two USA Tours in the first half of 2013.

“Fucking Brilliant” - DJ Mag

Their studio output is prolific to say the least; original productions such as Valley Of Paradise and the Lunar Escape EP, recent remix projects include Bryan Ferry, Haim, Boy George, Mirror People, Azari & III, Metronomy, Kauf and Mirror People.

""First-choice remixers that crisscross genres and scene affiliations"" - Thump

And then there’s the edits. Their recent version of Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’, a follow up to ‘Everywhere’, topped the Hype Machine charts and has gained some serious props from around the globe. They have also released a whole host of edits on their Healin’ Feelin and Discotheque Wreckers imprints, all of which made the Juno top sellers list.

""Spectacular ...such class and style"" – KCRW

Their mixes paint the story of two extraordinarily talented and passionate guys. Some blatantly show that Psychemagik can absolutely dominate a dancefloor. Others, like their guest mixes for the Test Pressing podcast, are gorgeously composed psychedelic experiences, which give you an idea of just how deep and amazing their record collections really are. Basically, you can bet that they have the perfect record for any time and any place.

""Perfectly deconstructed Hot Chip's sound for their support slot…Fantastic!""– Songkick

They also have a reputation as the go to guys for mega rare records and samples that you won't find anywhere else. Their satisfied customers include 2 Many Dj's/Soulwax, Chemical Brothers, Q-Tip, Fake Blood amongst many others.

It is this incredible ear for musical treasures and their dedication to the art of digging that has lead to the success of their recent compilations, Psychemagik Presents: ‘Magik Cyrkles’ and Psychemagik Presents: ‘Magik Sunrise’ on Leng Records, both of which sold out worldwide on vinyl within hours of release and featured in the top 5 of most good record shops bestsellers lists.

With a wealth of upcoming releases just around the corner, they've already set the controls for the heart of the sun and will be heading into a whole new stratosphere of creativity.

Bio: The best proof of love is trust – that counts for the lovely partnership in life as well as for creative arts. Whether in your own talents or in the well-meaning fate: trust mostly paves the cheerful way to happiness. The Berlin based electronic duo AKA AKA are the best example that trust in your own personal work does not only disburse, but is also spelled with elements of courage, faith and strength of purpose.
When Saarland-born Hannes and Holger from East Frisia met each other at a Berlin open-air party in 2008, it wasn’t only the start of a refreshing friendship; they found the infamous wavelength in very short period of time. With different socialization equipped, they both use their divergent past as well as the joint project AKA AKA to give their common ambition a name. With Oliver Koletzki’s label Stil vor Talent they found their first home in 2009. With its catchy grooves and minimal aesthetics, their debut EP ""Vögeln"" did not only reflect the spirit of that time, but was supported by the likes of Richie Hawtin and Troy Pierce.
The track „Woody Woodpecker“ with his didgeridoo intermezzo and deep bass was featured as the third best track in the category minimal of 2010’s Beatport Music Awards. Spurred by the growing number of experiences as a live act and slightly before releasing more material on Stil vor Talent, the two set up their own imprint Burlesque Musique in 2009. Starting with the passion of freethinking and moving electronic sounds ranging from swing, Balkan-influenced house and funk, the current techno-driven orientation including pathetic melodies reflects AKA AKA’s bandwidth. The label is not only the way out of the release madness of the industry, but an inspiring stage for young talents and new faces. Besides formidable EPs of Umami, Niconé and Budzillus, with their „Springtide EP“ AKA AKA & Thalstroem made their first appearance on Burlesque Musique in 2011.
Hannes and Holger were immediately fascinated by the gentle skills of trumpeter Thalstroem as they first met him in a vodka bar in Berlin. In March 2010 they played at Berlin's Watergate for the first time as a trio – and the experiment should not remain an experiment. Together with Thalstroem, AKA AKA worked on their joint debut album ""Varieté"". Published in May 2011 on Burlesque Musique, the record was not only honored by the readers of the prestigious Groove magazine among the top albums in 2011, the reader poll of the Partysan magazone awarded AKA AKA & Thalstroem as ""Best Live Act 2011"" and the second best newcomer. With its mid- tempo house drive and deep minimalism, the record represents their final catalyst. Especially in combination with Thalstroem and his ""Electronic Wind Instrument"" they put a final touch to their unusual, fresh and dreamy trademark sound, which provides live even more endorphin boosts. Whether heard in Berlin clubs like Watergate, Ritter Butzke, Tresor, Magdalena as well as Arena Club or during their international gigs in Amsterdam, Madrid, Moscow, Oslo, Turin or Vienna – AKA AKA & Thalstroem are kings of entertainment. Always open, always engaging, always fun.
After several remixes for Oliver Schories, Turntablerocker and Thomas Schumacher, in May 2012 the trio introduced a veritable Who's Who of the scene for „Varieté Remixed“ in order to present new interpretations of tracks from their debut. Besides Tigerskin, Moonbootica and Lexy & K-Paul other big names like Dapayk, Marek Hemmann and Phonique rearranged standout tracks like ""French toast"", ""What Matters"" or ""Afterglow"". In the same year the first and foremost live act AKA AKA &
Thalstroem went on a great tour, not missing festival as Timewarp, Sea of Love, Sun, Moon, Stars, Mayday, Nature One and Super Rave. In addition to new releases and parties of their label Burlesque Musique, the trio is planning a new, second album for 2014. That's right, the journey of AKA AKA & Thalstroem is far from over, because who stops wanting to be better, ceases to be good.",88488,314,http://www.facebook.com/akaberlin,http://www.facebook.com/akaberlin,,http://www.youtube.com/user/AKAAKAlive,"http://www.akaaka.de

ComputerClub,Chill/Mainstream,Michael Gigantor,http://soundcloud.com/computerclub,presidentofthecomputerclub@gmail.com,"Bookings/Requests contact: presidentofthecomputerclub@gmail.com

BIO: The Computer Club sound first emerged from Gigantor's studio in 2007 when his single “Load Rocket” started gaining artist acclaim and making noise in the blog circuit. The song, one of the first completed by Gigantor under the geeky guise, carried Computer Club’s name into both traditional record label outlets and the burgeoning music blogosphere alike – a trend rarely seen in the heavily populated landscape of today’s dance music. Original songs like “Flat Response” and “Laptop Levitation” showcase Computer Club’s highly honed sound design and audio engineering skills, while his edits of Nine Inch Nails, Friendly Fires, Prince, and New Order illustrate his ability to adapt the best of the big names to the dancefloor.

Along with his impressive studio output, Computer Club is a well-accomplished DJ by any measure. His steady stream of gigs has him traveling to every corner of North America with regular stops in New York City, San Francisco and everywhere in between. From rocking a strong crowd at L.A.’s Electric Daisy Carnival to dropping an intimate set for his former home of Atlanta, Computer Club constantly exhibits his deftness and versatility behind the decks.

While remixes of Combichrist's ""Throat Full Of Glass,"" Mr. Oizo’s “Flat Beat,” Jewel Kid's ""Break My Heart"" and his notorious collaborative re-working of Konflict’s Drum & Bass anthem “Messiah” with Le Castle Vania have helped propel his name to new heights, Computer Club also released an EP titled “Nerd Secrets,” which to showcases a wide swath of musical styles, ranging from dancefloor-filling, hands-in-the-air bangers to rock-inspired songwriting to experimental dancefloor weirdness. Among the tunes on ""Nerd Secrets"" was the heavy hit 'Losing Streak,' featuring vocals by UK pop genius Frankmusik, this tune charted in the top 40 in the UK and also went to number 1 on hypemachine.

In 2013 Computer Club released the ""Win Or Lose EP"" which featured collaborations with rising stars MUST DIE!, Anna Yvette and Gosteffects, also included remixes from Infuze, Rule Of Eight, and Prototype Raptor. Along with the attention that this release garnered, Computer Club continued to make noise with the release of another MUST DIE! collab, ""Payback,"" on Never Say Die Records, and made the blog circuit once again go nuts for his drum and bass reworking of Daft Punk's ""Doin It Right.""

In addition to his Computer Club moniker, Mike continues to push the boundaries of dance music as one third of Evol Intent, a hard-hitting Drum & Bass trio considered by many fans and DJs alike to be the genre’s most talented American group. Initially known as purveyors of the toughest brand of D&B, their debut album “Era of Diversion” exhibits a musical variety influenced by everyone from Radiohead and Aphex Twin to Slayer and N.W.A.

Impressive numbers like these, which recently landed him at #5 on Billboard's Next Big Sound chart, aren’t just a testament to his top-notch production skills, but also his keen ability to build and harness a highly interactive online fan base (1,500+ Facebook Fans added weekly). In 2012, Microsoft recognized that direct audience connection and chose Wick-it to produce a song for their Windows 8/Angry Birds: Star Wars commercial that they blasted to millions of prime-time viewers. With successful headline tours supplemented by huge sets at major festivals, it’s obvious his talent and success extend far beyond the studio.

Multi-platinum record selling music producer, Glenn Morrison is the archetype of the modern DJ/producer star. The 30-year-old Toronto native is as happy rocking an underground house party as he is performing at an exclusive oceanic rooftop venue; as adept at composing an international club anthem like ‘Contact’ as he is at concocting a pop dance record that strikes to the Billboard Charts in America.  His single ‘Goodbye’ has been Certified Double Platinum and went Number 1 for 11 weeks in a row on the Canadian Billboard Chart, as well as going Number 1 in Russia’s Billboard Chart.  It wind up taking over Eastern Europe and became Number 1 in 7 Countries to date.

He is signed to Sony Records, Universal Music Group and Sony Music ATV as a writer, producer, & recording artist. He has been nominated for several Juno Awards in 2015, as well as Fans Choice Award / Dance Artist of the Year / Dance Record of the Year for Sirius XM Radio Music Awards, and won the SOCAN Dance Record of the Year 2015. 

Glenn has enjoyed the support of DJs as varied as John Digweed and Richie Hawtin to David Guetta and Tiesto. For three years he was resident at the world's best club, Ibiza’s Amnesia Club, and was a resident at Space in Ibiza for 1 year, as well as Space in Miami for 2 years. Last year, Glenn added the latest addition to his residency repertoire in his monthly night being held in Las Vegas at the acclaimed Moon Nightclub at the Palms Casino.  And he is perfecting a sinuous, hooky sound that combines the eerie beauty of pure techno with light rains of melody and flashes of emotion.

In short, Glenn Morrison is one of the most dynamic and accomplished talents in electronic music today. Period.

Morrison is a difficult DJ to pigeonhole and that’s what makes him such a fascinating talent. One minute his sound is ruthlessly minimal and funky; the next it’s washed in color and vocals and emotion.

Glenn has had an unusual career path. He started off as a classical pianist, a preteen prodigy, performing  – and winning – competitions. Then came a life-changing encounter with electronic music.

Production continues apace in the new mastering studio Morrison has built in Toronto, entitled Alpine Mastering (www.alpinemastering.com). Be it sound design for video game companies like Nintendo, EA Sports, Activision or Rockstar, or his own productions, he simply doesn’t stop making and playing music.  His latest partnership with IMAX has been a thrilling experience, pushing the boundaries of electronic music to that of sound-scoring live theatre visuals.  Glenn & IMAX unveiled this concept with a 3 part show series at the 2012 ComicCon event held at the Ruben H Fleet Science Centre in San Diego, and it was a huge success. “It’s been a liberating transition for me to make music for all different stylistic purposes, and I’m very grateful for having the ability to do what I love for a living” says Glenn.

Watch this brilliant artist over the course of 2015 as he will be reshaping and redefining how we perceive electronic music through an ample amount of live shows, performances, and recordings.

BIO:
"" German music producer Leon Weber ( aka. LCAW ) was born in Munich in 1994. Raised in a musical family, with a mother as a music professor at the University of Graz, LCAW began playing the piano at age two and continued to learn several other instruments like the cello and the drums soon after. All these years of music education served LCAW with a great knowledge base that led him to produce his first tracks at age 18. LCAW’s fascination with electronic music was ignited by his first club experience and the general rise of the German house music scene. Inspired by artists such as Paul Kalkbrenner, Bonobo, Parov Stelar and many more LCAW produced his first remix of British band ""Daughter"", which became an instant success on YouTube and Soundcloud. Soon after Remixes for ""Parov Stelar"" and ""London Grammar"" won over the blog community and gathered millions of streams. One of the stunning aspects of LCAW is the speed with which he’s created a large and devoted fanbase all over the world. After only 2 years in the music business his music collected more than 60 million plays with several appearances in the “Hypem” top 5 and for the past year he’s been touring the world as a DJ, and soon as an live act. First original music pieces are set to be released early 2016, so the journey is just about to start... ""

“The one thing I knew was that I wanted this record to be a trip. When I go out, I want to give myself up to music. That was the idea for the album.”

If the main motivation whilst making Drone Logic was to take the listener on a hi-fidelity trip for the duration of his debut album, then Daniel Avery emphatically succeeded. From Water Jump’s hypnotic pulse and punch through to the crystalline click of closer Knowing We’ll Be Here via the title track’s elemental acid swirl and New Energy’s take on Neon Lights relocated to a post-midnight cab ride through London, Avery’s debut pushed and pulled at the senses and blurred the boundaries between dancefloor and home listening experience. Released on Erol Alkan's wildly psychedelic Phantasy label, reviews were unanimous in praise: ""A mesmerising debut"" (Mixmag); ""In a league of its own"" (NME); ""Exceptional"" (The Times); ""One of the finest techno albums of the year"" (The Quietus); ""Underground dance music with this much ambition hasn't been heard in quite a while"" (Resident Advisor); ""Avery owns this space"" (Pitchfork); ""A benchmark for so many other dance albums to aspire to"" (Dummy). 

Its success has been furthered by the fact that Drone Logic doesn't really fit expected templates of what a dance record today should sound like. There are no set piece vocals; when voices emerge on tracks, they are invariably disembodied, odd. And as distortion whips across techno-based backing tracks, it splices modern club music with the kind of sounds that forward thinking guitar bands might conjure up. The result is wholly compelling, gloriously transcendent and one that immediately struck a chord with club DJs, from heads of state to the best of the new class.

Coming off the back of his massively lauded FABRICLIVE 66 compilation, many of Drone Logic's first steps took place from the DJ booth out onto the dancefloor of that very London clubbing institution. Whilst Avery claims that his music is affected by every stop on a relentless tour schedule, one that earned him 32nd position in Resident Advisor’s DJs of 2014 poll, his debut was a record very much conceived in fabric. It seems natural, therefore, for his residency to be taken one step further with Divided Love, a quarterly curated night:

""fabric is my home and I'm proud to be a resident; the club has been with me from the beginning. Divided Love is about presenting acts who are doing something special…sonic souls, faith affirmers, music for the mind…""

The night, now expanding across Europe and beyond, can be seen as a direct extension of Avery's new radio show on another of the capital's underground mainstays, Rinse FM. A chance to push mind-expanding sounds from a myriad of places beyond straightforward club music, it is another platform for Avery to “bring this music together. Something is happening at the moment.”


Culminating the cycle of Drone Logic, and as he begins work on his sophomore record, Daniel Avery expands on his wide reaching world with a carefully curated album of remixes from the artists with whom Avery’s forward facing electronic style shares the deepest affinity. New Energy [Collected Remixes] is an album featuring reworks from Rødhåd to KiNK, Factory Floor to Powell, Silent Servant to Roman Flügel, Perc to Beyond The Wizard’s Sleeve and stands as a testament to the strength of the current state of affairs in electronic music, borne out of one of its most original talents.

Whatever happens next for Avery…that's going to be the real trip.

70s rock, 30s swing, hiphop, triphop, pop, jazz, soul, classical music are as many shades N’to can use to colour his tracks. However it is through electronic music that he expresses and fulfills himself completely. He creates a distinctive, pure and « pointilliste » sound that already makes him a key player on the French techno market. He works every inch of his generous rhythmic, he deconstructs the sounds, betrays our habits and yet those melodies of his go straight to the point and far beyond our expectations.
Creating Hungry Music label alongside with his friends Worakls and Joachim Pastor is a chance for him to let his imagination and musical eclectism flow freely so that he continuously reinvents himself. That’s how appeared his latest project, N’to Perc Live 2015, illustration of this blurring of the borders between electronic and acoustic.",85633,51,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nto/50860802143,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nto/50860802143,http://twitter.com/#!/ntohungry,http://www.youtube.com/user/NtoTunes,"http://www.hungrymusic.fr
