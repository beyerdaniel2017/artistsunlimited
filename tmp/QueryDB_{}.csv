KleanMuzic,,Klean,http://soundcloud.com/kleanmuzic,taurosmusic@gmail.com,"As a child Klean (Dana Essex Jr) Muzic was born to a musician father and an artistic mother in Detroit MI. He grew up in a household where Motown Soul, P Funk and 80’s POP were a mainstay on the record player. Unlike the average child forced to take lessons, Klean had a desire to play piano. He tinkered around at home on an organ his mom purchased learning the theme from the movie Beverly Hills Cop and Shelia E’s ” The Glamorous Life”.  He began to listen to prolific Jazz players like Herbie Hancock, George Duke, Joe Sample and Ramsey Lewis, wanting to expand his knowledge further. An opportunity came to take piano courses in school under the wing of Funk Brothers legendary keyboardist, Johnny Griffith at Northwestern High School. He absorbed a lot of knowledge and discipline during his schooling.  To further his education Klean took Jazz 101 under the tutelage of concert pianist and composer James Tatum of the world renowned James Tatum Trio at Wayne County College. These studies helped push Klean over the edge with his musicianship. After his older cousin introduced him to Hip Hop music by artists like RUN-D.M.C, Public Enemy, Eric B & Rakim, Big Daddy Kane and countless others, Klean fell in love with Hip Hop and it became a part of his DNA. He felt it was time to show his creative side so he joined forces with a neighborhood drummer and a DJ to create a band/production team called Canned Funk Organization.  Producing upcoming Detroit singers and rappers, they also started to produce a young and rising Detroit rapper who is now known as Elzhi of Slum village.  After meeting an LA producer who was visiting Detroit at the time, Klean got the chance to travel to Los Angeles and work with Crimelab Productions. He assisted in the production of tracks for The Luniz, Dub C, The Dramatics, Yukmouth, Yoyo, Kam, Tha Realest, The Gospel Gangsters, D the mad Bitch and others.  As he learned more about producing he ventured out on his own and started producing works for his younger brother Tauros and the Pop/Funk duo The Funktastics.  Fast forwarding to the present, Klean has moved into the field of mastering. Currently bringing life to tracks for soul singer Barsheem’s debut album “What Is to Be Major”.  Looking towards the future Klean continues to chase technology as well as preserve the traditional and organic process of recording music.  Branching out to score film, soundtracks, video games and more, He has definitely become a producer to watch.
