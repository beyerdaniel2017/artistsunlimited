Souleye has earned rave reviews and a rabid following for his rousing and powerful style that challenges paradigms and incorporates Hip-Hop, EDM, and Funk. Souleye has been touted as, “Hip hop’s medicine man,” “America’s new leading edge voice,” and “a modern day hip hop warrior.” After releasing 2012’s Iron Horse Running and touring the world playing sold-out arenas with Alanis Morissette, an inspired Souleye returned to the studio and exited with a wealth of new material. Souleye released the three song E.P Identified Time, in May, followed by his full-length Shapeshifting in October and a has a brand new album called Wild Man set for release in early 2016. 

Souleye will be joined on stage for his exciting new live show by the production duo Crush Effect who produced his upcoming release Wild Man. Crush Effect’s experience with live music runs deep, as members David Veith plays keys for Karl Denson’s Tiny Universe, and Jesse Malloy plays sax for The Pink Floyd Experience. The Souleye live experience will feature live saxophone and keys blended in with extended instrumental hooks and Souleye’s signature flare on the mic to make performances anything but a traditional hip hop show. 

Souleye’s career began when he won a spot on Jam Cruise in 2005, a contest put on by Relix magazine, which included members of P-Funk, Les Claypool, Digable Planets, Michael Franti, Bela Fleck and Bassnectar. Over the last ten years, Souleye has released five full-length albums as a solo artist and has been featured on the recordings of Bassnectar, Mimosa, STS9, The Glitch Mob and Michael Franti. Souleye has over five hundred live shows under his belt with as and has toured performing with Bassnectar and as a live Emcee for San Francisco band BLVD. In addition, Souleye has made numerous live guest appearances with Michael Franti, Random Rab, EOTO, and MIMosa and countless others. He has performed at Coachella, Ultra Music Festival, Burning Man, Shambhala, and has toured extensively in the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America.

The Souleye experience is one of body and spirit. With stratospheric instrumental hooks and positive, conscious lyrics, Souleye’s audiences look to him for guidance, inspiration and profound entertainment. Souleye’s infectious energy and lyrical positivity rooted in human experience invites listeners to unleash their potential, and let loose their most primal instincts. “My music is geared towards inspiration and positivity. I offer my lyrics as an opportunity for listeners to more deeply explore their relationship with their own human spirit. I want to help open the minds of listeners and support people along their journey.” 

Just as the title of his latest release suggests, Souleye shapeshifts and explores a wide range of styles throughout the album. Souleye’s uplifting, positive and melodic brand of hip-hop pays homage to the genre’s past while blazing a trail into the future.

It was always deeply embedded in him since birth. While he was in high school and college, he always found himself at parties wishing he could be in control of the music. He wasn’t interested in partying; he was interested in orchestrating them. Hank's mission is to destroy musical injustice in the form of DJ sets chock-full of music that people can enjoy and move to. He is often asked what he is playing and is often told that his selection is unique and excellent. This is because he spends hours each day carefully digging for gems anywhere he can. He loves sharing these sounds with the world and hopes to be able to do so more often and for more people. It’s a musical story that’s forever under construction.

About Me.

GUEUSH - pronounced 'GOESCH' - is a DJ living on the edge of the north sea at Ostend city, Belgium.

His love for music started back in 2006, influenced by a wide range of sorts. Back in the days, he experienced with different genres but always had a soft spot for pure house music.

He supported many local events where there was nothing but good music on the menu. Filling his mind with quality sounds he needed a place to share his thoughts. Ostend's nightlife was the perfect spot where he could set his mind free. 

Earning credits from local hotspots like Copador, Krush Club, Instant Karma and Ostend Beach he quickly became a pioneer for many.

As day comes and night falls he loves to build up the vibe with a refreshing sound of underground house music with a twist of soul, disco and hip hop samples. 

Expect a mood that is funky, playful and will surely boost up your desperate housewife. Starting from the bottom or picking up at a danceable hour, he's authentic sound will definitely put your heels on fire.

Born in the 80's he really knows his classics by heart. ... and whenever it comes from the heart it always feels good, right?! Let's DANCE!

Jackie G,House,Jackie G,http://soundcloud.com/jackieg215,jackiegbooking@gmail.com,"Jackie Gallagher (Jackie G) was born and raised outside of Philadelphia and has called the city home for over 8 years. A Marketing & Event Coordinator by day and an up-and-coming DJ by night, she recently became the first-ever female to join the Bangarang Beat Corps.
 
Her signature style is a work in progress, but is the culmination of exploring several different genres of house music. Influenced by past and present-day music, she is particularly drawn to soulful beats with funky grooves and disco nuances, blended with garage, tech, and bassline house. In her sets, you can expect an excellent track selection, with ample emotion, all with the finesse to make you move.
 
Jackie G is also a member of The Athena Collective, a new network of women in the music industry (primarily DJ's and producers) seeking to connect, empower, and inspire one another. Since she took to the decks in 2014, Jackie has progressed by leaps and bounds, and continues to build her skills every chance she gets. She is excited for all that the future holds in continuing to explore and share her newest passion with the world.

Come one, come all! An experience like none other in Houston and Austin, TX, Cirque Noir invites you to join us in the obscure and luxe vignettes throughout our city for a taste of the latent dark circus that surrounds us. Local sound artisans and visual experience engineers collide in a recurrent evolving masterpiece taking place when you most want, and least expect. We laboriously hand select our evenings' rotating ringmasters from the underground elite, and supporting sideshow oddities and freaks serve only to pulse us deeper into the dark night. What is below, so will be above.

When darkness falls, Cirque Noir's big top Caligula ensues... and you wont want to miss it.

Born as a producer of electronic music, with influences from deep house to techno, all proudly made in Colombia.

Since early years starts to develop a vein for the music, learning notions of saxophone, playing the bass drum and other percussion in the marching band in his school days. 

Years later he decides to learn guitar and play piano by himself,  with this whole knowledge and love for music started to produce his own tracks and constantly look for a personal/ unique sound, then the idea to create the concept of 'Push 92' come to his mind. 

After, with a little of luck and a lot of talent started to sign with international labels and make his music count.  
The snow ball began to grow, generating recognition and open the doors to play in clubs, hotels and house parties around the city of Bogotá.  

Recently his music has been spinning on different radio stations around the globe, like Radionica Fm (Colombia) , KEXP Fm (US) Ibiza White Fm(Spain), En Lefko (Greece) and Bondie Radio from Australia.",394,22,https://www.facebook.com/Push92,https://www.facebook.com/Push92,https://twitter.com/Push_92,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWvhPQ6docpjavunsGgfoRw,"http://push92music.wix.com/push92
