A child of the garage generation Hannah Wants has validated herself as a world renowned DJ with some serious credentials.
 
In 2014 alone Hannah picked up the Best Breakthrough DJ title at the DJ Mag Awards and became Mixmag’s Best Breakthrough DJ and Star of the Year.
 
Armed with an innate desire and passion to practice the art of DJ'ing from a young age Hannah has worked tirelessly for over a decade to pursue her DJ dream. Throughout this journey Wants has acquired an individual hard-hitting style and true competence behind the decks.
 
Nourishing her addiction to music the Birmingham (UK) born DJ dedicated the summer of 2010 to Ibiza. Following a number of competition wins, an unexpected headline opportunity at Es Paradis and an invitation to run her own weekly night at Viva, it was there on the white isle that Hannah really started to make a name for herself.
 
Hannah’s main aim is to build a solid yet unique reputation for her live DJ sets and after a record amount of sell out events over the last twelve months she has dramatically risen from self-taught DJ to an unquestionable worldwide name on the house and bass music scene.
 
Championing music that is true to herself, Wants further constitutes herself as one of the biggest names in dance music with her newly appointed Radio 1 residency, bi-monthly mixtape series and music productions.
 
What Hannah wants, Hannah seems to earn. 2015 welcomes her new and self-titled brand ‘What Hannah Wants’ – the title will be leading Hannah’s headline tours, various festival takeovers around the globe as well as readily endorsing new found talent along the way.
 
With a majestic career already under her belt it’s Hannah’s developing knowledge, skills and experience alongside a true enjoyment of music exploration and giving back to her supporters that will see her name remain at the forefront of the electronic music scene."

Datsik,https://soundcloud.com/datsik,Festival,3767458,"❃ Datsik 2016 Spring Loaded Tour ANNOUNCED ❃
Support from Ookay and Drezo
TICKETS: http://www.springloadedtour.com

Since launching the Datsik brand, Troy Beetles continues to evolve as a solo artist all the while pushing his beloved bass music world to new lengths, both on a personal artistry level and as a genre as a whole. From bedroom producer to chart-topping artist, internationally touring act, and owner and founder of the enterprising Firepower Records, Datsik is poised to make bass music the sound of the future with his recent Down 4 My Ninjas EP (Nov. 2014 / Firepower Records) and upcoming release Smoke Bomb ft. Snoop Dogg (Nov. 2015 / Ultra Records). 

Datsik took his initial steps into global dominance in 2009 with his first official release, the Nuke ‘Em EP, which set the new precedence of the future of dubstep and bass music. Immediately following that was the Boom EP featuring Excision and the legendary Flux Pavilion as collaborators. In that same year, Datsik claimed 10 Beatport #1 releases. Additionally, he has also released massive remixes for dance music icons Skrillex, Diplo, Kaskade, and Zedd, as well as two collaborations with Bassnectar and two more with Diplo on his Express Yourself EP. He has also remixed artists from the mainstream pop world and hip-hop spheres such as Coldplay, Lil Wayne, MGMT, Linkin Park, Wu-Tang Clan, one of the biggest influences on his sound, and, most recently, Lana Del Rey.

Nonetheless, Vitamin D, his debut artist album released on Dim Mak Records in 2012, remains his gleaming trophy of work. Rightfully so, as Vitamin D was the first project to illustrate the full spectrum of Datsik’s production cannon and to give glimpses of the artist’s potential as a producer and songwriter. Vitamin D was the first major milestone of many to come in the Datsik storyline. The next chapter came in 2013 in the form of a two-part release, the Cold Blooded EP and the corresponding Let It Burn full-length album, both released on Firepower. While shorter in length, Cold Blooded packs as much a punch as big brother Let It Burn. Hand in hand, Cold Blooded and Let It Burn comprise the knockout one-two punch in Datsik’s artillery.

Datsik stands at a point of transition with his recent EP Down 4 My Ninjas. It exemplifies a more mature Datsik, both in sound and in vision, as it sees the producer taking vast steps outside of dubstep and deeper into his ever-burning fondness for hip-hop. In essence, it is his love letter to the hip-hop and bass music genres and sees a full circle for Datsik as it combines the best of both worlds. Featuring collaborations with DJ Paul of renowned Southern rap group Three 6 Mafia and the legendary KRS-One, Down 4 My Ninjas sees Datsik keeping one foot in bass and one foot in hip-hop and, for the first time ever, sees the artist pairing his original productions with bona fide, universally celebrated members of the rap world. 

With Down 4 My Ninjas in tow and a hefty supporting tour scheduled for 2015, expectations are higher than they’ve ever been for Datsik. Beetles welcomes the challenge, though. It’s what’s kept him developing since those bedroom producer days, and it’s what verifies Datsik as one of the leading figures in the bass music scene of today and tomorrow.

Justin Timberlake,https://soundcloud.com/justintimberlake,Chill/Mainstream,7850811,
David Guetta,https://soundcloud.com/davidguetta,Chill/Mainstream,2045373,"Universally accredited with being one of the first DJs to open up the world of electronic music to global chart audiences, transforming the sound of radio and with it, the musical tastes of millions of listeners across the world in the process, David Guetta has established himself as a true, modern day dance icon.
After first making his presence most notably felt in the US with his production work on the Black Eyed Peas‟ „I Gotta Feeling‟ in 2009, a track that has since gone on to record over 8.3 million sales and establish itself as the biggest selling download in U.S. history, Guetta effectively laid the foundations for what is now a burgeoning, worldwide dance music scene. This success translated across the Atlantic too, with both „I Gotta Feeling‟ and the equally anthemic „When Love Takes Over‟, featuring former Destiny‟s Child songstress Kelly Rowland, both rocketing straight to the top of the UK Singles charts. Similarly, Sexy Bitch ft Akon, hit the top spot in multiple countries and made David not only king of the clubs, but a household name.
Following the subsequent release of Grammy-nominated, platinum selling albums „One Love‟ in 2009 and follow up „Nothing But The Beat‟, both of which have boasted numerous #1 singles such as „Titanium‟, „She Wolf‟, „Without You‟ and featured collaborations with everyone from Snoop Dogg to Sia; Usher to Nicki Minaj; Lil Wayne to Rihanna, Guetta has continued to build on his vastly impressive, ever-growing musical legacy.
In total, Guetta has sold more than 8 million albums and 40 million tracks. Not bad for a DJ!
Fast forward to 2014 and having focused on his own „Jack Back’ imprint throughout the first half of year - the label from which he cultivated the careers of then-budding DJ‟s Nicky Romero, Avicci, Afrojack, Showtek and more – David released a trio of club singles including „Bad‟ and „Shot Me Down‟ that have each hit the #1 spot at Beatport within their first respective weeks, he is now channeling all his efforts towards what will be an incredible sixth studio album. The new major single “Lovers On The Sun” will bring together the three Jack Back singles for a summer 2014 EP; sure to be an anthem in the Balearics and beyond.
It is also worth noting that Guetta is now regarded as one of the world‟s most popular figures on both social media and streaming platforms. He has close to 55 million Facebook fans, 15 million Twitter followers and 2 billion YouTube views. Plus 5 million Spotify followers which is well over half their registered user base. The stats speak for themselves.
As well as his influence on the culture of dance music and its subsequent impact on popular music across the world, Guetta has also helped solidify the notion of the DJ being the artist. Not just prolific and talented producer, David is a DJ first and foremost and tours non-stop. He has already played to well over 1.5 million people in 2014 alone, reinforcing not only the global reach of his music, but the unprecedented demand that exists to watch DJs perform. Headlining multi genre festivals, EDM gatherings and his own stadium shows, he has helped lead the change of the landscape - forever.
Having also recently announced coveted Ibiza residences at both Pacha and Ushuaia, as well as an extended run of European festival dates across France, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Sweden, Iceland, Italy, Russia, Spain and Scotland before the summer is out, 2014 is shaping up to be one of David Guetta‟s biggest years to date."

Sean Kingston,https://soundcloud.com/seankingston,Chill/Mainstream,2922944,"Kisean Anderson, best known by the stage name Sean Kingston, is a Jamaican-American reggae fusion rapper and songwriter. Known for his dark lyrics, Kingston won the 2007 MOBO award for Best Reggae Act and a Teen Choice award for Best R&B track. Born in Florida, Kingston grew up in Jamaica with his grandfather, reggae producer Lawrence “Jack Ruby” Lindo. In 2007 at the age of 17, Kingston was discovered on Myspace by Tommy Rotem, of Britney Spears and 50 Cent fame, who signed Kingston with Beluga Heights Records. In a joint venture between Sony, Epic Records and Koch Records, Kingston released his first single, “Beautiful Girl”. It was an instant success, reaching number one on Billboard’s Hot 100 and topping international charts. His next single, “Me Love”, released at number one in Australia. Later that same year, Kingston toured with Gwen Stefani and Beyoncé as an opening act. The collection of singles was released as his self-titled first album later that year. In 2009, Kingston released his second album, “Tomorrow” with Lady Gaga, produced by RedOne. The single “Fire Burning” debuted at #5 on Billboard while “Face Drop” climbed to #61. In 2010, he joined the UK group Sugarbabies to record “Miss Everything” and was featured on Bow Wow’s single “For My Hood”. Over the next two years, Kingston released multiple singles featuring guest appearances from T-Pain, Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Akon and Dr. Dre. He appeared on Justin Bieber’s single “Eenie Meenie” and his cover of “Pretty Boy Swag” and “Billionaire”. In 2011, Kingston released his free online mixtape “Kings of Kong” which featured Akon, Soulja Boy and Justin Bieber. His most recent album, 2012’s “Back 2 Life”, peaked at number 33 on the R&B Album charts and #52 on Billboard’s Hot 100. The single “Beat It” with Chris Brown and Wiz Khalifa reach number 17 on Hot R&B charts."
Tiësto,https://soundcloud.com/tiesto,Festival,1530310,"""The Right Song"" is now available on iTunes and Spotify. 
http://tiesto.lnk.to/therightsong

For Tiësto making music is about giving. The Grammy Award-nominated electronic dance music icon offered up his greatest gift yet in the form of his fifth full-length album and career first for a major label, A Town Called Paradise [Casablanca Records/Republic Records]. That's saying a lot considering his track record too…
 
He's gone from an underground trailblazer to a worldwide superstar who opened the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and was voted ""The Greatest DJ of All Time"" by Mixmag and the ""#1"" DJ by Rolling Stone. He's headlined festivals around the globe including Ultra Music Festival, Stereosonic, Coachella, Tomorrowland/TomorrowWorld and Electric Daisy Carnival; and has a storied 20-month residency at Hakkasan Las Vegas Restaurant and Nightclub and Wet Republic pool at MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. Artists ranging from Kanye West and Coldplay to Katy Perry and John Legend have personally tapped him for high-profile remixes, while Guess, AKG and Audiofly have collaborated with him on a fashion line and headphone brands, respectively. Moreover, A Town Called Paradise yielded his first two gold singles in the U.S. with the singles—""Wasted"" [featuring Matthew Koma] and ""Red Lights""—while a medley from the album also soundtracks a presentation at the Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas, a first for a dance music artist. With Sirius XM, he launched the ""Club Life"" channel (the only dance music artist to do so), nodding to his acclaimed compilation brand of the same name—now in its third installment. In December 2014, Tiësto was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Remixed Recording, Non Classical category for his remix of John Legend’s “All Of Me.” This is Tiësto’s second Grammy Nomination; following 2008’s inclusion in the Best Electronic/Dance Album category for Elements Of Life.

Producer & DJ.

GIRL FROM BERLIN.
__________________________

In times of an already vast ‘Soundcloud-Generation, that is continuously growing and bringing forth new and highly ambitious DJ’s, it is certainly not easy to separate yourself from the herd. However, the search for individuality and exhilarating mix between a casual mood and a breeze of the past decades brings us straight to the music of a talented young artist: introducing, LOVRA.

Being born in the German provinces, Laura discovered her love for music in her early childhood. Her excellent sense in rhythm and her affinity for aesthetical movements brought her to into the world of ballet on a very young age. The following years Laura her enthusiasm towards sounds and tones peaked and slipped its way into her professional career path and enabled her to express her versatile creativity.

After studies in Design, Laura moved to Berlin. The German capital finally gave Laura the creative environment she was looking for. In the epicentre of the artistic freedom she found new impulses and ideas for her music, making the move to Berlin one of the best decisions in her life.

As a successful graphic designer, model and recently music producer, Laura bundles her creative activities under her artistic name LOVRA. LOVRA is a free spirit who has given herself the objective to unite her passion and vocation in a magical/wondrous way. Just recently she has signed her first major deal and couldn’t be any happier with the growing positive feedback of her followers: “Berlin is a very open-minded city. To be able to meet and learn from inspiring new people on a daily basis and to be introduced to their opinions and perspectives is something that means a lot to me!”

By combining her attraction towards music from the eighties and nineties and her natural feeling for modern melodies, LOVRA creates her own distinctive sound. Her tracks, full with groovy House-tunes, striking vocals and danceable beats, will reverberate in our ears for a long time.
LOVRA, who keeps reinventing herself with every gig she plays and every track she makes, carries us away with unparalleled sound spheres. Driven by the curiosity for new beats and wanting to give the music of the past decades a loving homage, LOVRA is well on track. With her remake of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On” and her own creations, she already gave us and her crowd some wonderful moments. We are very much looking forward to a thrilling career and to an artist that has earned the right to be called “unique” more than anyone else.

DJ Dechard,http://soundcloud.com/djdechard,Chill/Mainstream,6143,"Riccardo Di Benedetto (born 21 July 1989), better known by his stage name Dechard, is born and raised in Italy with Belgian origins. He has culminated a vast creative portfolio with influence both from his native European roots and his new American experiences in Los Angeles.

Dechard established himself in both the urban and electronic music genres as his music has a vintage, yet modern vibe. Stomping grooves, dreamy chords, cinematic atmospheres, and an array of collaborations with other artists all act as catalysts for Dechard’s fully original style and sound.

Since the age of sixteen, Dechard has been performing in clubs and across many different stages. He studied sound engineering at Essex University and has built his own recording studio, worked on a variety of projects, and he landed a deal to officially remix a single for Alex Vargas (EMI, UK) with music producer Jeroosalem. He’s also released remixed for artists such as EDX, Bob Sinclar and Phaze Project.

His first EP was released in 2013, ‘Amazing,’ an album inspired by Dechard’s desire to take his art a step further by departing the European music scene for America. Shortly after arriving in the United States, he has been discovered by the Hollywood publicist Charmaine Blake and also worked on a soundtrack for a Fox television series, ‘Dos Lunas’. 

Dechard released two more EP’s in 2014, ‘Three Gems’ and ‘Balloons' (Irma Records, Italy). He’s also produced a record for the rising star Sabrina Petrini in collaboration with Gabe Lopez (Universal) winning several American awards and obtaining a nomination at The 58th Grammy Awards as ""Best Pop Duo"".
His debut single going by the name of ""Ricky Dechard"", to be expected in 2016, is currently in the works.

Throughout his life, Nathaniel Knows embraced and absorbed an eclectic array of quintessential vibes, honing his unique skills as a genre-bending DJ. Struck by love at first sound, he found his passion for music starting at the tender age of fourteen, in West Coat hip-hop. From hip hop beats he graduated to Trance, DnB, metal, and even Hardcore. As an aviation technician in the navy, he traveled the world picking up new rhythms and learned to produce via PK (A.K.A., the Puerto Rican King), on board the USS JFK. From there he wandered from Florida to Arizona, until he finally landed in the big city, Portland, Oregon. There he hit music hard, branded himself Nathaniel Knows (https://www.facebook.com/nathanielKnowss), and formed with DIGIRATTII https://soundcloud.com/digiraatii


He also works with producers such as HATIRAS http://soundcloud.com/hatiras ,SPL (http://soundcloud.com/spl), TRIAGE (https://soundcloud.com/triage) The Bassist (https://soundcloud.com/bassist) Nate Feelz (https://soundcloud.com/natofeelz) El Cucuy ( http://soundcloud.com/el-cucuy )  GANG$IGN$ (http://soundcloud.com/djgangsigns)

Red Bull Thre3style US Champion, Lollapalooza 2015 artist, and Chicago Sun Times' #1 DJ (Sun Times' #6 in the U.S.) has been producing music for just as long as he has been gracing the turntables (fifteen years), and playing drums for even longer (two decades). In addition to extensive touring across North America, he has headlined internationally in numerous cities including Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), Beijing (China), Taichung (Taiwan), Stuttgart (Germany), and Zurich (Switzerland). His traditional musical background, including a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies, is a rarity among electronic musicians, and has helped get his original music placed on networks such as MTV, VH1, ESPN, and Style, labels including Firepower Records and Brooklyn Fire, and commercials for Bacardi, Hefty, and Kenmore. While Thre3style put him on the world stage, his passion for dance music, inspired by his home city of Chicago, is what will keep him there."

Wax Motif,http://soundcloud.com/waxmotif,Creative,44038,"TRUE JOY EP – OUT NOW on Mad Decent:
http://maddecent.lnk.to/TrueJoy

Fav jams, updated regularly: http://bit.ly/WaxxyWavez

BIO::
Born in Australia as Danny Chien, Wax Motif’s unique production style and mixing skills have kept this rising producer in high demand. Continually wowing fans and industry insiders, his production efforts have drawn critical acclaim and support from the likes of Diplo / Major Lazer, A-trak, RL Grime, GTA, Oliver Heldens, Jauz, Knife Party, Tommy Trash and more.

Wax Motif has become a pioneer for the G-House movement, working with Destructo for his album on Interscope with the likes of Ty Dolla Sign, YG, Yung Thug, Problem, Kurupt and Warren G. His DJ sets already incorporate this style heavily into his mixing, and 2015 will see a lot of original productions in this vibe.

To pigeonhole Wax Motif’s music would be disingenuous, however. His influences range from R&B, to disco and UK bass, and his diversity in the studio has attracted the attention of everyone from Mau5trap to OWSLA.  His debut EP for Mad Decent, True Joy, is a reflection of this multi-genre approach, albeit with a G-house focus.  

 No stranger to the festival circuit, Wax has played EDC Las Vegas, New York & Mexico, HARD Summer & Day of the Dead, Holy Ship, Stereosonic and Splendour in the Grass to name a few. Wax has released tracks and remixes through A-trak’s Fool’s Gold, Skrillex's OWSLA, and Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak Records, a compilation on legendary label Strictly Rhythm as well as a host of remixes for the likes of YG, Kid Ink, Chromeo, Deadmau5, Warren G’s “Regulate” and more.

Pyrrhic is the primary force behind the mysterious power of hipsters. This trend setting genius has a backstory as big as The Hulk on steroids and many believe him to be as crucial to life as the air that we breathe. Often famed for slaying dragon’s and being the only person to have a stare-off with medusa, Pyrrhic is also assumed to of accumulated 12 Olympic gold medals, 4 World Cup Trophies and the coveted Weight Watchers member of the year title (albeit under a different guise)… But who really gives a fuck!?

Anyway… 10 years ago, Pyrrhic went through a series of unfortunate events, spending nights intoxicated by enigmatic substances (some even say they once saw him licking an endangered toad for a new high). This mystifying combination of narcotics enabled Pyrrhic to hear the world in a different way, hence is obsession with music. To contain this, powerful members of the underground unicorn world trapped Pyrrhic in the phantom zone in the fear of him unleashing forward thinking, experimental music on the world.

Now, in the year of 2014… Pyrrhic has escaped! After being trapped for 10 years, Pyrrhic has mastered the art of spirituality and connected his soul to that of the unicorns. He is now traveling the world on his beloved unicorn recording all of the peculiar sounds he once wanted to create. With influences from Tonga to Taiwan, Pyrrhic is doing it for the love and musical enlightenment… Musical genius has never been so accessible!

Biography:
Reaching more than one million of clicks per month just on Soundcloud, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko attain massive stats for an underground artist. It must say that the Belgium duet didn't steal this success! From their recent remixes to the first appearance on Tiefblau with “Drop it Like it’s Hot, the duet sail between a Nu-Disco, Deep-House dance-floor oriented to a Melodic or Tropical House music, as a journey. Like this summer 2012 in Ibiza where Vijay & Sofia decided to create this duo.
As a couple, in life and behind the decks, Vijay & Sofia, they lead the discussion on social network and on the dance-floors since 2 years, but the career of Vijay started well before, with collaborations as the like of Camilo Franco Nico Pusch or Rodriguez Jr. Without forgetting the past, Vijay open the doors to the duet at the end of 2012.
An artist can share his life only with another artist, and that's why the duo works so well. Sofia has the soul of an artist that sticks to the skin. A well-chosen word for a tattoo artist. This graphic artist with a strong universe is also a huge fan of music and dance (More than 12 years as dancer) and Vijay led him to be with him behind the decks and software productions.
The first success of Vijay & Sofia will come from some of these free Remixes and Edits available on Soundcloud for the followers. In two year, they will remixes artists like Asaf Avidan, Daft Punk, John Newman, Kiesza, Ben Howard, 2Pac, A$AP Rocky, Duke Dumont, Gabriel Rios, Buena Vista Social Club, Queen, Nicolas Jaar , and many more…. Proof of their talent, the label of Daft Punk contacted Vijay & Sofia to release their remix of Get Lucky on Columbia in Vinyl Edition.
Except the several free download offer to their fans, the releases on major nu-disco & deep imprints are coming on Warner Music, Tonspiel, Tigers Records, Delicious Recording, Sleazy Deep, Sleazy G, Street King, Tiefblau Records, Dear Deer, Spirit Soul Records, Future Allianz, Love Style, KiezBeats and others…, and reaching several time the best sales of Beatport.
Still an eye on the future, Vijay & Sofia Zlatko will release soon an official remix for Feder, Moby, The Disco Boys, Lexer, Nico Pusch and other surprises . And if the future of electronic music will be displayed with the belgian colors?:)

________________________________

Matt Halper and Eli Sones, the young masterminds behind Two Friends, have quickly revamped from high school bedroom producers to one of the most promising dance music duos of 2016. Known for their viral remixes of “Trap Queen”, “I Miss You” and “Cool”, the two have, in unprecedented time, mastered a wide range of genres from deep, melodic house to harder progressive cuts. With their Spotify and SoundCloud views now exceeding 17 million and with eleven #1’s on Hype Machine, the boys are well on their way to becoming the next big dance act to come out of America.   

Kicking off their musical journey in senior year of high school, the boys honed their skills through remixing, taking on the likes of The Chainsmokers, Blink 182, Tori Kelly and Alesso to name but a few. Perfecting their distinct “Soul House” style, Two Friends were quick to prove their versatile production techniques, drawing upon a wide variety of live instrumentation to create a truly multi-faceted sound with every release. After receiving the “Award of Independent Excellence” from Hollywood Music in Media Awards, Two Friends swiftly exceeded their influence beyond the online sphere, attracting the spotlight on stage and radio. While Don Diablo was dropping Two Friends remixes on Hexagon Radio, their remix of Lana Del Rey’s hit “Born To Die” scored airplay on Sirius XM, securing the boys a top ten spot in the BPM Hits Chart in 2014. 

Following multiple performances at San Francisco’s Ruby Skye, as well as shows at New York’s illustrious Webster Hall and the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, the boys soon branched out to venues in Denmark, Mexico and Canada, showing off their potential in the international arena.

With support now coming from the likes of The Chainsmokers, Krewella and Tritonal, and with a whole host of original releases locked in for 2016, Matt and Eli undoubtedly look set to dominate this year and beyond. "

Bio:
A native of Tokyo, Japan and now resident of Los Angeles, California - starRo, the rising sun whose story permeates much farther than the music he makes, but rather an embodiment of sacrifice, persistence and passion, is now solidified as one of Soulection's wisest, and most experienced music makers. starRo makes soulful electronic music, period. And he makes it with the utmost diligence and craftiness that requires listeners to participate with absolute, undivided attention. Listeners in end, leave the journey mystified and elevated to a sultrier state. 
starRo's musical maturity and ability to captivate an audience of world wide music lovers comes second to none, and inspires many of his Soulection label mates in their music making processes. Having toured the United States, Canada and throughout Asia, playing alongside artists like Flume, Chet Faker, Gold Link, Giraffage, starRo pulls his creative inspiration from not only eclectic artists like Stevie Wonder, Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Neptunes, Sly Stone, J Dilla and Bill Evans, but also the visual arts, architecture and nature, his father and all sushi chefs from around the globe. 
Remnant of mid 90's R&B, paired with lush chords and atmospheric melodies as his forte, starRo's sound is now ready to be embraced by the larger international, electronic beat scene. After dropping a very successful, and passionate, Soulection White Label release in December 2013, generating over 240,000 plays in the first month, starRo's resonance has left everyone anticipating his forthcoming project in late 2014. 2014 will also see starRo showcasing w/ Soulection at SXSW in Austin, Texas in March, as well as an early April Asia tour through Japan and Korea with label brethren, ESTA and The Whooligan."

Say hello         
info@deep-chills.com

Deep Chills, born in Milan as Gianmaria Sanna, started his affection with music by taking up guitar lessons at the age of 14. He quickly progressed to producing music although he originally started out producing hip hop beats, which later transgressed into EDM. It was when Deep Chills originally heard New Orleans by Naxxos when he knew he had to start producing in a genre later to be known ‘tropical house’.

He broke through in this genre in 2014 by remix tracks into very popular melodic deep house adaptations. Inspired by artists like Naxxos, Matoma & de Hofnar he reached extraordinary numbers on Soundcloud with both his remixes like You Got The Love and originals like Feelin’ Good & Lighthearted.

With remixes on Ultra Music, Universal, Ego and his first proper original releasing on Miami Beats, we can be sure to hear a lot from this Italian producer this year.

Kungs (pronounced « Koongs ») is a 19 years old producer from the south of France. He started his musical career with a djembe gifted by his parents to him at the age of five. From these early days Valentin could spend entire afternoons listening to Rock’n’Roll classics with his father. From The Who to The Kooks with many in-between, this essential listening forged the first steps to Kungs inspiration as an artist. 

Discovering a passion for electronic music in his teenaged years, Kungs became infused with interest for melodic sounds and crafted timbres always lead by a dominant vocal. By the age of seventeen his interests had evolved, and creating melodies using his own instruments became a passion. 

Shortly after his first experiences with a digital production software, Valentin was sharing remixes across the board of online social networks. His remix of Bob Marley - ‘Jammin’ and Lana Del Rey ft Molly - ‘West Coast’ both boast several million plays on Soundcloud & YouTube.  


After a few unofficial remixes, official remixes requests were around the corner. From Axwell & Ingrosso to Lost Frequencies, Kungs quickly became a key remixer for the other DJ producers. Kungs’s remix of « Are you with me » counts now more than 16 million views on Youtube and more than 65.000 fans are following his Soundcloud page.

Simoultaneously, his first original track “To Describe You” became available.
This collaboration with Mozambo featuring Molly instantaneously hit one million plays on Soundcloud. 

With early support slots with significant acts from many aspects of the melodic house landscape such as Kygo and Klingande, Kungs has quickly formed into a well established artist in the scene today with a tendency to provide driven and impressive production and live sets. 

In January 2016, Kungs traveled the European continent alongside David Guetta in order to ensure seven times the warm-up of his Listen Tour.

On February 16th, Kungs released his new single "" This Girl "" melting the soul voice of the Australian band Cookin' On 3 Burners with his powerful hooks. Only a week after the release, ""This Girl"" was already charting all around Europe and keep growing every day.
Other original tracks are around the corner so you better stay tuned."

BIO:
"" German music producer Leon Weber ( aka. LCAW ) was born in Munich in 1994. Raised in a musical family, with a mother as a music professor at the University of Graz, LCAW began playing the piano at age two and continued to learn several other instruments like the cello and the drums soon after. All these years of music education served LCAW with a great knowledge base that led him to produce his first tracks at age 18. LCAW’s fascination with electronic music was ignited by his first club experience and the general rise of the German house music scene. Inspired by artists such as Paul Kalkbrenner, Bonobo, Parov Stelar and many more LCAW produced his first remix of British band ""Daughter"", which became an instant success on YouTube and Soundcloud. Soon after Remixes for ""Parov Stelar"" and ""London Grammar"" won over the blog community and gathered millions of streams. One of the stunning aspects of LCAW is the speed with which he’s created a large and devoted fanbase all over the world. After only 2 years in the music business his music collected more than 60 million plays with several appearances in the “Hypem” top 5 and for the past year he’s been touring the world as a DJ, and soon as an live act. First original music pieces are set to be released early 2016, so the journey is just about to start... ""

Winner of the style award by Musikexpress, category ""Best Upcoming DJ 2014""

“Support from industry heavyweights abound, The Him’s penchant for sultry remixes is on display...and the results showcase a duo whose name is ascending with every free download.” - Aaron Berecz for Dancing Astronaut

Hailing from Amsterdam, The Him is a music production duo (aka Jeroen & Steven) creating buzz with their smash hit singles, official remixes and monthly Midnight Mixtapes. Gaining inspiration from artists like Daft Punk, Duke Dumont, Empire of the Sun and The Chemical Brothers, The Him's sound is an infectious union of indie, deep house, nu disco and pop – full of fresh, experimental and sometimes tropical beats bound to make you move and wanting more.

With an exclusive premiere on Dancing Astronaut, their latest single “Feels Like Home” quickly hit #1 on SoundCloud’s Deep House chart, went viral on Spotify, claimed #4 on DMC’s Buzz chart and garnered more than 3 million plays in only one month on their SoundCloud page. The single, featuring the smooth vocals of up-and-comer Son Mieux, continues to attract international attention from magazines, bloggers and fans alike, with interviews and special mentions from EDM Sauce, Your EDM, DJ Mag NL, MrSuicideSheep, EDMTunes and countless more. Heralded as a “Dutch masterpiece” by radio 538 legend Wessel van Diepen, “Feels Like Home” is the 3rd official single from The Him, after two chart-topping collaborations with famed DJ/music producer Sam Feldt. In addition to their singles , Jeroen and Steven have also dropped official remixes for the likes of The ChainSmokers, Otto Knows, Shift K3y, Shaun Frank, Adrian Lux, Solomon Grey, and Dotan.

Their Midnight Mixtapes, featuring the latest deep house tracks - including their own - continue to grow each month. With over 60,000 avid followers on SoundCloud, amassing millions of plays, The Him is also supported and played by the some of the world’s biggest DJs including: Tiësto, Felix Jaehn, Oliver Heldens, Don Diablo, The Chainsmokers, Sam Feldt, and more. Cementing their position in the dance music scene and blossoming in their creations, The Him are most certainly artists to keep an eye on over the next year.

Bio

Zimmer writes dreamy, modern and colorful house music. He is part of the new wave of Paris producers redefining French House, alongside Roche Musique label mates Darius, FKJ, Kartell and more. 

In the few years he’s been around, Zimmer’s made his name largely of blog-hit remixes, earning millions of plays and support across the globe. He broke out in 2014 with his remix for Danish singer MØ , clocking over 5 millions plays. His original work proves just as good: « Galapagos » is a luminous slow house gateway, while “Saturday Love” dips into night- time. True tastemaker, his religiously followed mixtape series keeps listeners in a year-round summer state of mind. 

His new EP « Coming of Age » marks his transformation into a well rounded artist ready to take it to the next level, with a more refined, minimalist sound. Recorded between Paris and Los Angeles, the EP oscillates between euphoric moments and nostalgia, seamlessly travelling between soundscapes. 

But perhaps the best way to experience the magic power of Zimmer is to see him DJ. His busy touring schedule took him all around the globe with over 80 dates in 2014, including sold out shows in NYC, SF and Paris. Coming of Age will be followed with a huge world tour that’s set to take Zimmer’s sound on festival stages and clubs alike. "

The Funk Hunters,http://soundcloud.com/thefunkhunters,Chill/Mainstream,48808,"Tour Dates:  http://bit.ly/1a7vZqL

THE FUNK HUNTERS
@WestwoodRecordings | Canada


The Funk Hunters are one of Canada’s top breakout acts, gaining accolades from all corners of the electronic music scene and pushing boundaries with the constant evolution of their live stage show featuring custom synched visuals and a LIVE 6-piece band. Nick Middleton and Duncan Smith have redefined their sound, bridging the gap between electronic and live music. Originally carving out a name for themselves by reviving and remixing rare classics, their focus has turned to creating original compositions and collaborating with world class musicians and vocalists both in the studio and on stage. Combining the melody and emotion of funk and soul with the grit and heavy punch of electronic drums and basslines, The Funk Hunters signature sound has been selling out venues across the country and leading them on tours around the world. During live shows, their 4-turntable Audio Visual set now shares the stage with a full band including live vocals, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, keys and drums.

The Funk Hunters have had a busy year and it’s no wonder why. Managing and producing music for their own imprint/record label ‘Westwood Recordings,’ coupled with their North American, European, Australian and New Zealand tours, the duo burst into the international music spotlight in 2012 and quickly gained momentum worldwide. Integrating a custom synced video set with live musicians is not only visually captivating but is pushing the boundaries of performance innovation. Awing audiences with their acclaimed audio visual show, The Funk Hunters Live set is charismatic, energetic and ambitious with no signs of slowing down. If you haven’t already, it might be time to get captured by the funk.

Biography:

Hailing from the Eastern Europe cultural hub of Bucharest, Boehm has quickly made a name for himself in Melodic and Tropical House circles. Though only releasing music under the moniker of Boehm until relatively recently, Alex has been producing music since the age of 12 getting his start in hip-hop and eventually going on to produce several pop hits throughout Europe. Since the conception of “Boehm”, Alex has chosen to set aside all other projects and leave behind all of the accomplishments accumulated thus far. The gamble paid off. Within the last 6 months, he has had four back to back #1 Hype Machine charting songs including his remix for Benjamin Francis Leftwich’s “Won’t Back Down” which hit #1 twice, his remix of Ben Howard’s “I Forget Where We Were”, his remix of James Vincent McMorrow’s cover of “Wicked Games”, and his most recent remix of Cheat Codes' ""Visions"". The widespread appeal of his music can be found everywhere from Tiesto’s weekly podcast – Club Life Radio (where his remix for Tiesto & Martin Garrix premiered on Sirius XM) to your local Starbucks in-store playlist (where his remix of Urban Cone & Tove Lo will be integrated worldwide for the month of August). Add to that an array of musical figures who became fans including heavy weight DJ’s such as Steve Aoki, NERVO, and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike who have requested official remixes from him. As the adventure continues, Boehm is now prepping his first batch of original tunes along with a number of high profile remixes for release in the second half of 2015."

Establishing himself as a leader in the tropical house genre within the UK. James has taken the world by storm with his incredible deep and tropical remixes and mixtapes. This young talent first captured the electronic community's attention with his fresh take on old-school rapper, Notorious BIG's track, 'Everyday Struggle'. James's live sets were born ready for the poolside, managing to encapsulate the beach vibe feel while at the same time maintaining a setlist injected with plenty of melody and old-school classics.

KENKODE & SKINFAKE are Cyberpunkers.
The “Cyberpunkers” project was born in 2006, from the passion of Cyberpunk culture shared by two Italian DJ’s. The group aims to give a fresh start to this style. In a nutshell, a transposition of the Cyberpunk world in modern clubbing. Through their performances at famous clubs, “Cyberpunkers” drew a lot of interest from the European media and ended up being much talked about for both their original look, consisting of masks behind which their true identity is hidden, and for the originality of their shows, in which they use two consoles at once and powered by several other audio machines.
Cyberpunkers have shared the stage at the biggest electronic European music festivals with a lot of worldwide stars.This intense travel and performance schedule did not prevent them from doing a lot of important studio work for their upcoming albums and remixes.

Ookay,http://soundcloud.com/ookaymusic,Chill/Mainstream,159260,"One of the most impressive young leaders of the American trap scene, California-based Ookay (pronounced “okay”) exploded onto the scene when both his freshman and sophomore releases on Ultra Records charted in the top 10 on Beatport. Since then, he’s shown no sign of slowing down, working with some of the greatest producers in electronic music while developing a signature style that weaves across genres, reflecting influences as varied as Borgore, Diplo, DJ Snake, Showtek, Deorro, TJR, Boaz Van de Beatz, Valentino Kahn, Waveracer, Cashmere Cat, Lindsay Lowend, Skrillex, Lido, and Wiwek while always returning to a hard-hitting trap beat.

The producer and DJ has racked up credits and quickly made a name for himself with remixes of tracks like Congrorock’s “Bless Di Nation Ft. Sean Paul” and Steve Aoki, Chris Lake & Tujamo’s “Boneless.” Ookay teamed up with iconic producer Diplo to remix Avicii’s “You Make Me,” and his recent remix of “Kanye” by the Chainsmokers on Republic/Dim Mak Records layers his signature mix of dance music and hip-hop over fluttering pop vocals. His side project Coaster serves as an outlet for his love of alternative dance and house music, proving Ookay to be no one-trick trap pony. 

His much-anticipated spring single ""Bouncer,"" produced with the venerable Dutch duo Showtek, hit the top 3 Beatport overall chart after its March 2014 release and was a staple on summer festival stages across the country. Ookay has also quickly become known as a charismatic performer both on and off stage, appearing at venues like EDC Las Vegas, Electric Zoo, Red Rocks, and TomorrowWorld. His live shows are known for sleek transitions, sensitive song selections, and entertaining MC’ing from the booth. He’s also no slouch on Twitter, commenting on everything from the struggle to Shazam an unknown song to LA’s Korean BBQ scene. 

It’s no surprise that Ghost, out November 10 on Dim Mak Records, is one of the most exciting dance music releases of the fall. Promised to be “a blend of listening tracks as well as club bangers,” it fulfills that goal. Ghost is one of the too-rare records that will bring you from your morning commute, with the meditative “Ghost” and “Matters,” to 4 AM on the dance floor losing it to “Egg Drop Soup.” 

The Ghost Tour this fall and winter is sure to blow up dance floors across America, and truly solidify Ookay’s status as one of America’s premier young electronic artists. With support from such icons as Showtek and Diplo as well as Tiesto, Steve Aoki, Major Lazer, Borgore, Nervo, David Guetta, DJ Snake, Deorro, TJR, Krewella and more, it seems certain that Ookay’s star will only continue to rise.

Biography:

Sonic architects of songs with an emotional heft as heavy as the subwoofer rupturing basslines that underpin their work, Truth are one of New Zealand's finest creative exports. Respected across the globe, since inception several years ago, Truth (Andre Fernandez and Tristan Roake) have, as both world-class producers and party-rocking DJs, cut a clear pathway through the international dubstep scene.

On the nightclub and festival circuits, the fruits of their labor have included, several European tours, countless shows across the USA, New Zealand and Australia, an action packed South American tour, and shows in Asia.  Truth has built this performance presence through DJ support from Mala, Skream, Youngsta, Hatcha and N-Type, to name a few, giving their music an advance presence at key club nights like DMZ in London, Club Love in New York and through seminal radio stations such as BBC Radio One, Kiss Fm and Rinse FM.

Through keynote DJ support, they have been rewarded with single releases via Deep Medi Muzik, Tempa Records, Wheel and Deal, Blackbox Recs, Aquatic Lab, Disfigured Dubz, Argon and Boka Records. Through these, including critically 'The Fatman' (as released via Deep Medi Muzik) and their acclaimed Aquatic Lab released album Puppets, Truth have seen their stock rise, placing them as in-demand remixers and collaborators to The Nextmen, Miss Dynamite, Shapeshifter, The Black Seeds, Silkie, Kromestar, Tunndige,  Datsik and countless figures of note within the international dubstep community.
Acclaimed by critics both within and outside the dubstep scene, their momentum is undeniable and impossible to ignore. Face the truth or get well outta the way.

Sometimes in arts, but certainly in life and especially in the art of sound: the eye and the ear are equal partners. Talking about the young and talented KlangKuenstler, you have to add another organ of perception: the heart. Music without emotion is useless. Emotional music reminds us that we shouldn’t think about yesterday or tomorrow, what counts is solely to enjoy here and now. Music should preserve our feelings, tickle out our endorphins and – in the best case – be a joyful escapism from the hectic everyday life. Welcome to the world of KlangKuenstler!

In 2012, the 22-year-old Michael Korb choose the way from bavarian solitude to the center of hustle and bustle when he moved to germany’s capital – Berlin calling! Only a few years before, he had his first contact with electronic music. His enthusiasm was activated by his first club experience in Munich, which came along like a revelation: loud music, people are dancing, the colorful lights and smiling faces everywhere. At the age of 20 years, his passion begins to professionalize. The KlangKuenstler start digging records and was looking for new and inspiring music. No, not the common chart material thrilled him; he was seeking for fresh tunes and a home for his first productions. In 2011, he founded the label “Zuckerton Records” to release his music and give other artists with a unique style a platform for their music.

His music is warm, mellow, and soft; it embodies a cheerfulness that you can describe like the perfect match between romance and hedonism. On his first productions indicates that KlangKuenstler is a musing dreamer: His track “Freudentraene” was a huge milestone in his young career and with three million plays on Youtube quite a success. 

It is said that nature gives a man his abilities, and the happiness brings them into effect. Talking about the KlangKuenstler, we have to add his almost impressive talent. With releases on labels as “Stil Vor Talent”, he has created an inimitable style and his own voice, which honors his alter ego: his deep and tech house is not only in love with melodies, but passionately produced. Think of a kaleidoscope that captures a variety of different colors. Whether it's jazz, soul, funk or his great passion for pathetic sensual strings – out of several mosaics he creates a total work of art that simply sprays a positive vibe.

Although he appears as a DJ from time to time, KlangKuenstler is first and foremost a live act, which wants to introduce his own productions in the club. Here he cannot only engage spontaneously to the particular mood of the crowd, but also arrange his own tracks in an always new and appealing way. On the Berlin based label Stil vor Talent he released his single ""Barfuss auf Wolken"", which is not only a highlight of his set, but already reached 1 000 000 000 plays on Soundcloud. The track is also featured on Oliver Koletzki’s „Schneeweiß Compilation II“. 

It does not need a glimpse in the crystal ball to predict a promising future for KlangKuenstler. In 2014, his debut album „That's Me“  was released. The long player embodies his own compass – it indicates his origins, his current status as an emerging live act and suggests new directions he will follow. Whether epic chords, his fetish for grasping bass lines or these joyful melodies – „That's Me“ is a multi-faceted, atmospheric and first and last a very emotional record. It is such a heavenly sensation to follow his heart. "

ILLENIUM (Official),http://soundcloud.com/illeniumofficial,Creative,132795,"There are melodic bass producers, and then there is Nick Miller. The Denver-based producer known as Illenium has been turning heads in the dance music community over the past year and for good reason. Illenium has distinguished himself from the myriad of others through an unrivaled ability to create an immersive emotional experience of highs and lows that pulls on the heart strings and leaves the listener awestruck, accomplishing in the span of just a few short minutes what takes many a full set. He has displayed an adeptness for creating aural arrangements that vary in style, yet always maintain beauty, complexity and emotional depth. Illenium gave the world a taste of what he has to offer in 2014 with standout originals “Falling In,” “So Wrong,” “Make Me Do;” remixes of Dawn Golden, Odesza, Oh Wonder; and performances at Global Dance Festival, Decadence NYE and other select dates. However, as foreshadowed by his inclusion in UKF’s “Ones to Watch: 15 for 2015,” this is poised to be Illenium’s breakout year.

The Legend...

Witnessing the destruction his family had caused as the first to be infected, Apashe confronted them. There was no escaping their wrath, and so, amidst the madness in the household, Apashe reached for his grandfather’s tomahawk.  As he ferociously swung the ancient weapon at the savages, Apashe knew the flesh he cut into repeatedly was that of his own blood; his own family.  Fighting for his life, Apashe’s mind spun and anger rushed through his shaking body.  In a final spit of rage and lunacy Apashe managed to behead the last attacker; his father. Horrified and drenched in sinew he stood among the mangled remains, blood flooding at his feet.  He had managed to escape their blood-thirsty urges.  As he reached for the front door, he glanced back one last time at his dismembered family.  His father lay closest, and reaching down and taking a two-feather necklace from his father’s headless body, he made a promise to avenge whoever was responsible...

Bass Astronaut/Dream Engineer
Owner @the-dream-vault

Luzcid's music is a sonic odyssey. A series of auditory adventures in which the participants completely escape time and space. He meticulously eludes genres in order to welcome a variety of enthusiasts to gather and celebrate the rewards of community. Luzcid hopes music can become platform in which the peoples of the world can reconnect and begin to restore our home to a place in which we all enjoy living.

He has already performed in almost every major US city and continues to spread his wings across the music community.Although his production stands proudly on its own ,Luzcid has proven he is one of those acts you need to experience live to get the full picture. He uses ableton live to weld a sonic quilt of sensationally hefty hip-hoppy psychedelic bass music. 

His song with Bassnectar ""Science Fiction"" is a splendid illustration of Luzcid's ability to collaborate and conceive a fierce beauty with one of EDM's most revered artists."

PRESS: samara.shwidock@umusic.com

Marian Hill is Jeremy Lloyd (production/songwriting) and Samantha Gongol (vocals/songwriting), an electronic duo producing songs that sound like a cross between Drake and Ella Fitzgerald, marrying bass-heavy, idiosyncratic beats and seductively soulful vocals.

The duo grew up together and their chance meeting in middle school, starring opposite each other in The Music Man as Marian Paroo and Harold Hill, now serves as the basis for their name. While pursuing separate musical paths, the two began writing together over college breaks, spending hours together perfecting lyrics and melodies —in the last of these sessions they wrote and recorded Whisky.

Jeremy blindly emailed Whisky to sixty blogs and within 2 weeks the track had climbed to the chart on Hype Machine. The buzz grew, the label calls began, and in early 2015 Marian Hill signed with Photo Finish / Republic Records.

“Got It”sees sexy vocals sail above early-Neptunes-era glitchy beats and handclaps before a melody transfixes, singing a mantra to individuality veiled in sly innuendo. The beat’s sparse backbone came to Jeremy on a bus ride home to Philadelphia for a writing session, and the song was completed by the end of the following day. On “One Time”finger-snaps and a bass boom keep time as Samantha’s voice casts a spell, twisting the old one-night stand into a song of female empowerment.

Their sound has just started to percolate throughout the zeitgeist at large, soundtracking numerous promotional campaigns, television shows, and packed nightclubs. Now prepping their debut full-length debut, they seek to push the limits of their content and sonics even further.

“We love the control you have in modern songwriting, because it’s not just music and lyrics - it’s everything. We’re writing an album of true, focused songs - where every component, from the choice of snare drum to the choice of lyric, is driven by one specific idea.”

Hectic has dropped a wide variety of tracks over the last few years, ranging from dubstep to garage and UK bass music. Previous releases including ''The Ripper'', ''Hard'', ''My Universe'' (featuring UK MC Janset) and ''Cyber Girl'', as well as various tracks on DJ Hatcha's label, Hatched, delivered a raw, uncut and heavy dubstep workout to the dance floors. Hectic also has an ever growing collection of remixes created for the likes of Modern Machines, The Freestylers, Adi Ulmansky, Veronika Vesper, Lindsay Mac, Them&Us, Lihot and Monkixx. He has received radio play and support from DJs on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Kiss FM, XFM, Sub FM and Reprezent Radio. This year, Hectic has set up his own label, Cover The Earth, which will aim to release forward thinking music from all realms of the spectrum. The first release on the new label will be ''Golden''. A collaboration project between Hectic and American/Australian singer and songwriter, Camille, due out in April. Setting the pace with relentless beats in a spacious and rough soundscape, it is clear that Hectic gives a new twist to multiple bass oriented genres.

------------------------------------------
Born and raised in Stockholm, Hellbergs love for music started at the tender age of 3, when he first began his one-man-shows for his family on his imaginary guitar. By the age of 13 he was introduced to the world of electronic music. From that early discovery, he was hooked, music has played a huge part in his life ever since.

Looking back at it Hellberg remembers spending countless hours in front of the computer grinding on his craft. By always prioritizing his music he missed out on more social events, parties and family activities than he cares to remember.

 

After many years of hard work Hellberg reached an important milestone in his career with his single ’The Girl’ feat, Cozi Zuehlsdorff, which was the first single of his EP titled ‘This Is Me’. The single saw fantastic results as it was Monstercat’s most streamed track of 2015, totaling more than 12 million streams. The EP was the start of a new chapter for Hellberg as it set the tone for Hellbergs evolved sound.

 

Hellbergs unbelievable work ethic and his astonishing dedication to his craft pushes him to always outdo himself. He does everything in his power to always deliver music that he feels and believes is a true testimony of his love for music.

There is something big brewing down in Melbourne; An underground club phenomenon that is bubbling away and surfacing upon the clubs and dancefloors worldwide. A sound, a vibe and a culture created around an energetic and unique ethos.
One of the bright shining stars of it all is a young and talented DJ/Producer by the name of Djuro. Known to his mum as Mitchell Browne, Djuro is at the forefront of this massive new movement displaying an enormous amount of talent and skill at such a young age.
Initially starting his love affair with music via the path of metal and hardcore in year 7, it was very evident early on that Djuro’s destiny and path in life was to be affiliated with music. As the years progressed Djuro consistently evolved always looking for that new and insightful sound that would keep him on his toes as both an avid music fan and more so an artist. This constant search led him to the bright and wonderful work of electronic music where he was mesmerised by artists such as Boys Noize, Proxy, The Bloody Betroots and more. It was at this time that Djuro really began to focus and hone in on production.
Fast forward only a couple of years and Djuro is a name on the lips of many. Championing a club friendly electro sound that is currently taking over the clubs worldwide, Djuro has plenty of Originals and Remixes under his belt. The most notable is his remix of Contiez ft. TreyyG – Trumpsta which has been absolutely smashed from coast to coast, Charted at 14 on Beatport’s Electro House Chart, and been one of the most well received club tracks of 2013 so far.
Djuro is a prime example of the modern day artist – A young, hungry and talented producer & DJ who works tirelessly at not just a sound, but a dance music revolution."

Not only has eSenTRIK racked up millions of plays with his future-R&B solo work, but he’s proven to be equally skilled at crafting booty shaking anthems as one half of @TWRK. Called a “top notch remixer” by OkayFuture.com, his vibed out reworks of 90s and current hip-hop tracks have been supported by many of his peers including Diplo, GTA, DJ Snake, Skrillex, and Major Lazer. eSenTRIK is already no stranger to receiving airplay on BBC Radio 1 and SiriusXM, so expect his upcoming solo project to be in steady rotation in 2016.

It’s easy to see why D.O.D is fast becoming one of the most respected Electro House DJs and producers.  Originally discovered as an ahead-of-the-game local DJ by Mixmag, whose editor Nick Stevenson declared, ‘D.O.D is one of the most talented young DJs and producers we’ve discovered this century. Expect big things.’  D.O.D has since released music on some the world’s most established labels such as Spinnin’, Laidback Luke’s Mixmash, Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak, Bingo Players’ Hysteria Records and Dyro's WOLV.

Originally from Manchester, UK, D.O.D (full name Dan O’Donnell) established a strong work ethic from the age of 15 playing long shifts in local bars and clubs, taking every opportunity to teach himself new tricks on the turntables.  This early thirst for experimentation was instrumental in his career taking off as it quickly generated appreciation from his more established collegues in the business.

A high-powered, charismatic performer, D.O.D intuitively knows how to read a crowd, and his well-structured sets, coupled with a compelling and dynamic delivery, never fail to fuel dance floor euphoria. Positioning his musical style as ‘Jump-Up Electro House’, D.O.D utilizes the full scope of his 4 CDJ set up alongside his own personal edits and bootlegs to greatest effect, citing as inspirational, among other eclectic influences, old skool hip hop scratch DJs.  Pioneer soon got word of D.O.D’s technical prowess and were quick to invite him to showcase a demonstration of their equipment in one of their legendary Pioneer DJ Sounds Shows and has since become one of their brand ambassadors.

In addition to his prodigious talent on the decks, D.O.D has rapidly made a name for himself as an accomplished, innovative dance music producer.  His debut records More Cowbell and Bananas stormed onto the international scene after Dutch legend and superstar DJ Laidback Luke picked them up for his iconic Mixmash label.  Championed by A-list DJs from day one, these two singles became overnight hits.

D.O.D has continued developing in the studio, refining his distinctive signature sound:  a mesmerising combination of high-energy beats and rhythmic bass-lines topped with catchy vocals.   His phenomenal non-stop approach has led to the huge success of three top 10 Beatport hits in the past year, including one of his latest  productions Bust Dem on Spinnin’ Records, a collaboration with American producer Henry Fong.  Others include All Or Nothing, and the massive collaboration Flashing Lights with Laidback Luke, which has to date notched up over 4 million plays on Spotify. 

Along with Laidback Luke, who continues to be a mentor and robust advocate of his work, D.O.D’s music is also strongly supported by such names as Hardwell, Blasterjaxx, Dyro, Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas, Like Mike, Tiesto and many more.

D.O.D’s own Freequence Radio showcase his own production as well as a throve of largely yet undiscovered names, stemming from a belief that encouraging emergent and grassroots talent in this way is vital if the dance music scene is to remain fresh and relevant.  Valuing his fans, D.O.D uses Freequence as a platform for releasing free music frequently to give something back to his dedicated and extending fan base.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, dance music is at its most potent when it’s born out of hunger, passion and talent. As D.O.D builds on his formidable reputation for epitomizing that lust for measured abandonment brilliantly, his intelligent approach and unfaltering work rate continue to drive him to be a key player in this competitive industry.  The scene now eagerly anticipates the inimitable D.O.D’s next move.

Adam K (Hotbox Digital),http://soundcloud.com/adamk,Indie/Alternative,35688,"Worldwide Bookings; andy@hotboxdigital.com


For Toronto, Canada’s Adam K, it’s tremendous amounts of skill, creativity, hard work, and years of perfecting his craft that have catapulted him into the upper echelon of dance music.

Fuelling his stellar live sets is over 15 years of experience in mastering sound design, audio engineering and producing. His keen ear for shaping sounds and knack for composing emotional hooks fuse together to create his trademark style. Adam’s solo and collaborative projects have dominated the underground including landmark tracks such as “I Can Feel”, “You’re Not Alone”, “Question”, and “From The Speaker” which melded the minds of Adam, long-time friend Soha, and Toolroom frontman Mark Knight. Of course it was another collaboration with Soha that captivated the world with “Twilight”. Named an Essential New Tune on the legendary BBC Radio 1, Pete Tong set the tone for one of the biggest records of 2008, which was confirmed by landing at #2 for the best-selling tracks overall on Beatport that year. Adam’s music is a favourite of the world’s top DJs seeing releases such as “Complicated” be a staple in sets from the likes of Tiesto, Above & Beyond, Gareth Emery, Matt Darey, Rank1, Judge Jules, Cosmic Gate, Menno de Jong, and more.

Not just an original composition mastermind in the studio, it’s Adam’s mind for remixing, along with partner Soha, that has catapulted him into superstardom as the duo’s remixes are some of the most pinnacle dance records of the past few years. Kaskade’s “4AM”, Benny Benassi’s “Come Fly Away”, Deep Swing’s “In The Music”, Heikki L & Ercola’s “Deep At Night” and most notably the Adam K & Soha Remix of Reflekt’s #1 UK Dance Chart tune “Need To Feel Loved” raised the duo to astronomical heights. Adam has reworked singles from dance icons Tiesto and Deadmau5, to mainstream chart-toppers Keri Hilson, Shiny Toy Guns, and Robyn, to one of the most legendary bands of all time in U2. It is his vision, passion, and technique that keep them in high-demand from international hit-makers and underground sensations alike.

Travelling around the globe, Adam’s mastery in the studio translates directly into the art of DJing and he has rocked single-show crowds upwards of 10,000 for legendary promoters and venues such as Ministry of Sound, Godskitchen, Global Gathering, The Guvernment, and Privilege Ibiza. From festivals across Europe, North and South America, Adam’s definitive sound blows up dance floors and pushes the hands to the rafters. Though primarily known for his melodic blend of progressive house, Adam’s style is much more diverse, and showcases his love for all things house, tech to electro, deep to banging. It’s this affection for many genres and his ability to manipulate a crowd into a frenzy that cements his status as one of the world’s most memorable performers.

Not just a producer and DJ, Adam is also the founder and head of Hotbox Digital. The label has been a vehicle for Adam to break into the industry and has released a multitude of incredible tracks from some amazing talent including Soha, Addy, Dataworx, Macca, and JELO. For 2010, Adam has a renewed focus on Hotbox, and will be expanding the label’s international reach both with fresh new original material and new signings from upcoming and established talent, including the massively anticipated Adam K & Soha track “Far Away” featuring the unforgettable vocals of Jeremy Carr, due out later this year.

With collectively over 4 million plays on You Tube and support from the world’s DJ elite, Adam has seen his music effect the lives of music lovers around the world. With the rise of Hotbox Digital and a full slate of touring, solo projects, collaborations, and remixes on the horizon, 2010 is the year of Adam K."

MGMT: <a href=""mailto:colin@mavenartists.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Colin (Maven Artists)</a>&#13;


___________________________________&#13;
&#13;
From his roots in the Drum and Bass movement, to the formation of his label Hollow Point Records in 2009, and now with the emergence of his trademark forward-thinking “Balearic Bass” sound, SMOG Records artist SPL stands poised to continue striking blows into the hearts and minds of EDM veterans and initiates alike.&#13;
&#13;
Sam Pool spent his early years in Oregon, studying music theory, piano, and drums; skills he would refine during a year abroad in Amsterdam, where he studied audio engineering.  His cutting edge fusion of styles balances equal parts reverence for musical history with restlessness for innovation.  Releases in the 2000's on revered D&amp;B labels Barcode, Tech Itch, and Evol Intent set the stage for a switch in 2008 to Dubstep- a move that was immediately supported by releases thru industry giants Sub Human, Rottun, and Amorphous Music. No stranger to the upper echelons of the Bass Music universe, SPL has been remixed by some of the biggest names in the game: Bro Safari, UZ, Big Gigantic, and The Panacea.  His remixes for the likes of Bassnectar, The Glitch Mob, Downlink, and Dieselboy exhibit his diverse approach in production styles and genres.&#13;
&#13;
Combining arpeggio-heavy 90's era rave elements with his own brand of Heavy Bass music, SPL's “Balearic Bass” EP forthcoming on Smog September 3, 2013, showcases this virtuoso producer at his best. With over 100,000 Soundcloud plays in the month of July alone on his genre-bending, dance-floor leveling track “The Future”, a BBC Radio-One mix comprised of 100% original music, ThisSongIsSick.com’s premiere of his Balearic Bootleg series, and instant support on the “Balearic Bass” EP from UK tastemakers Skream, Benga, and UKF, the world at large is set to discover something the underground has known all along- that SPL has been, is now, and forever shall be a leader in the world of Heavy Bass Music.

http://armadamusic.lnk.to/DWDontStopSO
Management & Bookings: (Armada) marc@chasedmanagement.com

Free Stuff: https://www.facebook.com/davewinnelmusic

Tommy Trash has told us that he is Australia’s answer to Deadmau5. Kicking off 2015 with a bang, Winnel announced he has joined the inaugural Armada Music family signing a record & management deal, while lovingly cooking popcorn on the side, it really is impossible to bundle Dave Winnel into the standard rabble of DJs and producers. Seizing a unique applause, the Dave Winnel sound strides in the future bass domain but with Winnel’s organic & melodic touch, and with continued support from the likes of Pete Tong on his Radio 1 Essential Selection & Oliver Heldens it is fair to say Dave Winnel is on cue & leading the way for Future House in Australia.

This Sydney sider broke boundaries with his buzz track Achtung!, (which ironically means Attention!) literally standing at attention being played at every major festival from EDC Las Vegas to the mainstages at Tomorrowland. The Winnel profile isn’t shy of an official remix devoir either, lending his skills to Clean Bandit for ‘Real Love’, Peking Duk’s ‘Take Me Over’ and #1 ARIA Club Chart theft with Glover’s ‘Faces’. High accolades from Michael Woods’ and his label Diffused Music have spilled in; Dave Winnel delighting his fellow producer, breaking the mold on his recent drops and officially remixing for the Englishman too. Celebrating raw talent Oliver Helden’s holds true to Dave Winnel, featuring three of his tracks on Heldeep Radio and personally thanking the Australian talent for making such great music.

Dave Winnel’s smooth performance method has roped in credit as 2014’s Ministry of Sound ‘Electro House Sessions’ asset charging with affect across the country, boasting electronic stamina and full commitment to the dance floor. It’s Dave’s highly acclaimed shows at Pacha Sydney, Platinum and The Met that are pioneering leaving just enough room for Australia’s hottest festivals Future Music Festival, Stereosonic and Summafieldayze where an electric guest spot from Dave is undeniable.

The times ahead call confidently for this young Australian talent, deviating from the norm and bringing the vibe with 2 remixes for Axtone and a slew of releases on ARMADA.

BLEEP BLOOP,http://soundcloud.com/bleep-bloop,Indie/Alternative,33215,"BOOKING:  
chad@spinartistagency.com

MANAGEMENT: 
evan@hthqgroup.com

Bleep Bloop’s musical world is one of stripped back, bass-heavy beats paired with stark,surreal soundscapes. Aggressive and off the wall sounds weave in and out of heavy drums as he blends genre’s into a low frequency style that works as well at a festival as it does in your headphones.

Bleep Bloop has earned the support of distinguished artists such as DJ Shadow, Noisia, 12th Planet,DJ Craze, Kode9, Boyz Noize, Minnesota, Herobust, and G Jones, to name just a few. He has performed at sold out shows in flagship venues across the country alongside DJ Shadow,Cashmere Cat as well as Low End Theory (LA). His music has been broadcast on BBC Radio1, Diplo and Friends, Rinse FM, and on every continent except for antarctica (maybe).

“Angular, brutal and barbed with a bass tongue that tickles with both a west coast and UK twang, it’s the sound Bleep Bloop has been cooking since he was first baptized by bass” -Dave Jenkins, UKF

Bass dipped in liquid question marks and rolled in lazers."

It is quite tragic that the greatest art
as a ruthless expression of a sensitive creative self
is almost inevitably linked to a kind of insecure self-centeredness
that makes it so difficult to be at ease with oneself and to really form
emotionally healthy connections with others
instead of the merely entertaining, yet superficial connections

Prismo aka Zach Burgett is a bass music producer/DJ from Houston, TX. Prismo started playing various instruments at a young age including the drums, bass, and guitar. He listened to and was influenced by a variety of bands like Primus, Radiohead, and Billy Talent. He was unsuccessful in his efforts to form a band of his own, so he learned to record and produce his own songs. Once he discovered electronic music acts such as Skrillex and Knife Party, he found his true passion. He began using his acquired production skills to produce electronic music, and hasn't looked back. Prismo has released music on stellar independent dance music labels such as Dim Mak, Firepower, Monstercat, and more. The year 2015 was a pivotal year in his development as an artist and has set him up for a monster 2016. Prismo is definitely one to watch this year, so keep your eyes peeled for lots of music, touring, and festival plays."

Then came the first 12” ep and after that nothing was the same as the record was favored by club dj’s and party music lovers around the world.

The now classic first ep has later followed with more top selling EP’s and Top Billin has grown into smoothly running record label with a big back catalogue with artists ranging from US to Chile to Russia to Japan and beyond. Besides running the record label and crafting top-of-the-line club tunes, Top Billin has become a well oiled party machine, rocking shows around the globe from Paris to Berlin and Moscow to New York, with the biggest names in the business & countless other club favorites. In 2008 they even made their first big tour supporting M.I.A. on tour. 

The key to Top Billin’s success is not rocket science. They are just guys who love music and like to have good time. All the time. While they’re very serious about their music, Top Billin are definitely no genre-stuck. With their roots deep in house, hip hop, dancehall, boogie and even rock, Top Billin likes to keep their music up-to-date and cutting-edge, both in the shows they play and the records they put out. That’s why you can pretty much count on the latest Top Billin release to always provide you with fresh sounding club cuts, remixes and /or original productions, anything that they feel like at the time being.

Beside being club goers favorites, Top Billin and the label have made fans among big name dj’s like Diplo, Basement Jaxx, Skrillex, Todd Terry, Flosstradamus, Sinden, Laidback Luke, DJ Snake,  Drop The Lime, Claude Vonstroke, Steve Aoki, Cajmere, Dillon Francis, Brodinski, Major Lazer,  DJ Godfather, DJ Funk, DJ Vadim, Benny Benassi, even DJ Tiesto and countless more. 

The times being tough for anyone producing/selling music, Top Billin have no intention to stop, good music never grows old and electronic music has never been so good as it is now.

""The best thing to ever come out of Alaska” - Diplo 

Astronomar has been a stalwart in the US club scene for many years lending his production efforts to labels like Mad Decent, Fools Gold, OWSLA, Dim Mak, Slow Roast, BNR Trax, Enchufada, Ministry of Sound, Top Billin and his own label Main Course (plus remix work for countless other imprints) and gaining support from many of the industry's leading tastemakers like Diplo, Skrillex, GTA, Clockwork, Congorock, A-Trak, Zeds Dead and Martin Garrix, just to name a few. His massive remix of Wax Motif & Neoteric’s ‘Go Deep’ (Dim Mak) blew up in 2013 after nightly plays from Skrillex & Boys Noize, including Ultra Music Fest and 2 years in a row at Coachella; it was also included on Skrillex's 2013 Essential Mix for BBC Radio1! His 2013 Mutant Club EP [Main Course] drew support from A-trak, Congorock, Torro Torro, Salva and your favorite djs favorite dj. More recently, his 2015 Magic Potion EP [Main Course] has received support from the likes of Porter Robinson, Diplo, and many more. Needless to say, Mar is always a few steps ahead of the curve when it comes to new & exciting sounds. 2015 has been shaping up nicely as Astronomar has completed his second Australia tour, played EDC Las Vegas for a second time, and made his second appearance on BBC Radio 1's Diplo & Friends. When Mar isn't touring the US & Internationally, he stays busy as the head A&R of Main Course Records, which is without question the hottest new boutique label in club music."

RUN DMT,http://soundcloud.com/rundmt,Indie/Alternative,28924,"___________________________________
BOOKING

___________________________________

RUN DMT’s sound reflects a torrid love affair with heavy basslines, thunderous beats, and haunting melodies. Formed in Austin, TX in the summer of 2010, RUN DMT approached heavy bass music without borders; touching on Dubstep, Drumstep, Trap, Moombahton, atmospheric Downtempo and more. In his short 2.5 year of history he has made high profile appearances at Electric Daisy Carnival, Coachella, The Vans Warped Tour, Camp Bisco, Nocturnal Festival, Wakarusa, Snowball Music Festival, and Counterpoint Fest . His original productions and remixes have become recent playlist staples for DJs ranging from Bassnectar to Flux Pavilion to Excision to 12th Planet and beyond. RUN DMT has also done official remixes for the likes of The Who (yes THE WHO), Major Lazer, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Fitz & The Tantrums, Figure, and Hundred Waters.

In 2011, RUN DMT’s first official release, “Drop Top” hit the top of the Beatport charts and remained in the Top 10 for six weeks. “Drop Top” was followed by a series of high charting EPs and a high profile inclusion on the Mortal Kombat video game soundtrack with “Baraka’s Theme”. RUN DMT capped off the year with a Mad Decent-released mixtape “Year of White Rabbit”.

In June 2012, RUN DMT released his debut full length album “Union of Opposites”, featuring Chali 2na, Dj Swamp, and Zeale, which hit #2 Dubstep and #11 Variety Charts on Beatport. RUN DMT closed out 2012 with a brand new 58-track, 140 minute mixtape, “The Existential Mix”.

In 2013 Run DMT’s official remix of Major Lazer’s “Jah No Partial” was released thru Mad Decent/Downtown. 2013 also saw the release of his remix for Dimitri Vegas/Like Mike/Lil Jon’s “Madness” on Dim Mak Records. A new Self-Titled 8-Track EP dropped in July 2013 to press acclaim from Vice, Rolling Stone, Magnectic Magazine, Thissongissick, and many other crucial tastemakers. 

2014 saw the release of RUN DMT's remix of Diplo's ""Revolution"" on Mad Decent Records, which ended up being featured on the commercial for the video game, Titanfall. Also released was the RUN DMT remix of Twenty-One Pilot's ""Car Radio"" on Fueled by Ramen. 
October saw the release of RUN DMTs remix of the godfather of bass Bassnectar's ""Now"" featured on the NVSB remix album. Late 2014 RUN DMT is co,pleteing his 3rd studio album"
