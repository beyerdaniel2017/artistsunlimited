Come one, come all! An experience like none other in Houston and Austin, TX, Cirque Noir invites you to join us in the obscure and luxe vignettes throughout our city for a taste of the latent dark circus that surrounds us. Local sound artisans and visual experience engineers collide in a recurrent evolving masterpiece taking place when you most want, and least expect. We laboriously hand select our evenings' rotating ringmasters from the underground elite, and supporting sideshow oddities and freaks serve only to pulse us deeper into the dark night. What is below, so will be above.

When darkness falls, Cirque Noir's big top Caligula ensues... and you wont want to miss it.

Born as a producer of electronic music, with influences from deep house to techno, all proudly made in Colombia.

Since early years starts to develop a vein for the music, learning notions of saxophone, playing the bass drum and other percussion in the marching band in his school days. 

Years later he decides to learn guitar and play piano by himself,  with this whole knowledge and love for music started to produce his own tracks and constantly look for a personal/ unique sound, then the idea to create the concept of 'Push 92' come to his mind. 

After, with a little of luck and a lot of talent started to sign with international labels and make his music count.  
The snow ball began to grow, generating recognition and open the doors to play in clubs, hotels and house parties around the city of Bogotá.  

Recently his music has been spinning on different radio stations around the globe, like Radionica Fm (Colombia) , KEXP Fm (US) Ibiza White Fm(Spain), En Lefko (Greece) and Bondie Radio from Australia.",392,22,,,,,12

He has played with many of the most respected artists in the dance music industry, including Beats Antique, Big Gigantic, Claude VonStroke, Destructo, Justin Martin, Polish Ambassador, Thomas Jack, TJR and the list goes on! Greg is also an integral part of the New England music community because of his involvement with Electrogenic, the Boston-based media and event production company, contributing to producing Camp Coldbrook Music & Arts Festival, and handling artist bookings and event management for countless club events.

Artist BIO 

James Martin

For James Martin, Discovering Electronic music in dark clubs at the impressionable age of 20 seemed a natural progression for a kid escaping the small town normalcies of rural New Zealand.
Hearing Craig Richards play shortly after the release of fabric 01 was a discovery and turning point for James and helped to shape the next ten years of collecting and producing.
Indeed Those early impressions still have an effect today. With over a decade of djing (and more recently producing) James still draws on the same sense of other worldly, deep and thoughtful music.

""My style can go from slow and dreamy to trippy and dark, but always with a narrative. Aimed at being evocative as much as it is to moving a dancefloor.""
Fast forward to 2005 where  James Co- Founded Auckland’s popular and still running club night SONIKTONIK alongside French maestro Cyril Orson which furthered his experience in the booth. Playing alongside the likes of DJ T, Mike Monday, Antix & Fiord, Dick Johnson, Greg Churchill and Simon flower to  a few.
A move to Melbourne in 2009 led to a long standing residency ""DE:TUNED"" at Melbourne’s now infamous Killing time with his partners in Crime, Aaron Stringer and Rhys Roberts.
 Most recently James has been spending alot of time in the studio and has had some success with  his debut track ""Lovebirds"" on Curl Curl records gaining praise and plays alike from the likes of MotorcitySoul stalwart Matthias Vogt, Makossa, Yoko0 and Arnaldo [Smallville]. With another EP in the pipeline  the future looks bright, in dark clubs.

SÄX,,http://soundcloud.com/saxmusic,bookings@sax.fi,"Mix a smooth saxophonist and a f*cked up DJ. Give the palette to Grizzly. Get the SÄXperience.

Contact: bookings@sax.fi

BIO:

“SÄX is a scientific experiment first launched when Andy Skädäm, a notorious saxophonist, found his long lost brother, a f*cked up DJ by the name of DJ Skittl3s. With his powers as a functioning alcoholic, Skittl3s reached out to their oldest brother Grizzly in order to ignore the boundaries and produce independent music without limits. After a few days of heavy idealism, SÄX was born, bringing you a combination of saxophonic vibes and messed up sounds, also known as the SÄXperience.

The rumours of the first SÄXperiences lead to the ancient city of Turku, Finland, and the first physical culmination is the EP ""Broadcasting in Paris"" released in May 2013. Why Paris? It has been said that Skädäm was a part of the French Revolution, that is all we know. The SÄXperience is a constantly changing phenomenon and a never-ending journey. Too deep? In other words, it is the shit.

We are SÄX, friends for life, brothers forever. Join the family.”",1402,30,,,,,3

Sickonce I Gijoe,Gijoe Sickonce,http://soundcloud.com/sickonce,gijoe@kimahera.pt,"DJs that are also producers. Now there's a line rarer than you might think in hip hop, both in and out of Portugal. Jazzy Jeff is one of the first serious references for that. And then there's the unbeatable DJ Premier. Or DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist. But most of them devote themselves exclusively to one or the other art. Kanye is seen mainly as a producer, as Mixmaster Mike is seen first of all as a DJ as the Beastie Boys will gladly confirm. GI Joe is DJ. And Sickonce is producer. Except that, unlike the other examples, GI Joe and Sickonce are also one and the same person.
Rafael Correia is the name behind the alter-egos, an architect by profession and arch-enemy of the music without groove, without punch or sharp kick and snare drums. This native of Portimão has been an early - late 90s! - active member of the singular hip hop scene in Algarve, with a curriculum that extends from Twism to Tribruto, and this just to name projects his been involved with at the most southern region of the country.
As a DJ, however, GI Joe has not been limited to scratching for others - besides the ones mentioned, we  can also find his precise cuts with a great flow in Royalistick and Reflect albums, for example - but he is also known to give extra work to clubs’ sound systems  all over the country. In the dj booth, the work of GI Joe is equally eclectic, always looking for the latest 'banger' able to stir crowds with an open style where hip hop meets dubstep, and where good taste reigns forever. Clear example: the duo Bass Avenue that he shares with Kombo and who explore the lowest spectrum of frequencies thought to the clubs.
On the reverse of this medal is working as Sickonce. Obviously, each influences the other facets: when the eyes see the dance floor almost always conclude what works, what bass lines do move the bodies, which sounds awaken the best reactions in people. And this privileged vantage point of the DJ is then transported to the studio where all these findings are put into operation. Sickonce produces beats that are unique, powerful, with a careful sound and wide open views. The latest example is his extremely well taken care of production work on the album Deep: her, a project that he keeps with emmy Curl and which has just premiered in album format. But Sickonce has a wider discography, including the mega-project Palavra de Músico, which ventured into the production of more than fifty tracks with various guests. A milestone for the 'do it yourself' spirit in national hip hop.
GI Joe and Sickonce, incidentally, are two identities associated with one of the most active cells of hip hop in Algarve and nationally, Kimahera, house of ambitious projects, with a particular  identity that counts several years of existence and that has done much to keep hip hop music on the map nationally. Rafael is one of minds behind Kimahera.
In common, GI Joe, Sickonce and, why not?, Architect Rafael Correa have a passion for solid and fluid building, be that a set grounded in classics but with a distinctly modern touch, beats that are underpinned by a strong rhythmic foundation, or buildings of brick and cement built to last generations. That’s the only way to build the future. That of music and that of the country.

#THISISGM,Gianmarco Morales,http://soundcloud.com/tagthisisgm,info@gianmarcomorales.com,"Apparently every Soundcloud page needs a fancy bio written in third person narrating the life of its user. Stating their amazing talent and why people should hire them yesterday. Saying stuff like “Jeremy Jeremyson started making music coming out his mother’s vagina, the doctor slapped his ass and a majestic cry in C-minor inspired the world to become a better place.” C’mon people, here’s my story.

I’ve been making mashups for over a year now. During my senior year in high school, I decided to give music and DJing a try and won the first edition of the “I am the Third Party” competition by London’s EDM giants Third Party. If I won recognition by them, I couldn’t suck that much right? Anyways, I went all conservative and got into med school. There I realized life is all about doing what you love, and Progressive House became an essential part of who I am. I did two semesters and dropped out. 2 weeks out of college, I got my own show at local radio station Be997 (Which also hosts Ryan Seacrest and Pete Tong!)

I studied EDM music production and am now doing my weekly radio show “This Is Gianmarco Morales” and making my own tracks and remixes. I’m trusting my gut and pursuing my dream.

I’m Gianmarco Morales, 20 years old, and I hope to become successful doing what I love.

Enjoy my music!

Bio
In the last 4 years Habbo Foxx has accomplished the sometimes impossible for any DJ. 
That mammoth task is to earn a reputation and become established in large competitive cities like Leeds, Doncaster, Manchester and Nottingham.
Dance music you could say is in Habbo’s blood, with a family dynasty of musicians his sister a renowned percussionist and his farther the legendary PAV on Percussion.
A worldwide musician PAV has played with some of the globes biggest DJs in a career spanning  15 years, this has enabled a  young Habbo to learn the tricks of the trade and finely tune his musical ear to make him one of the north’s most reputable, reliable and up and coming DJs.

Habbo has held a residency at ‘Bar Fibre’ in Leeds for over 3 years and continues to entertain the masses on a weekly basis. This is done by not only giving crowds what they desire but always changing up the game with his signature sound of contemporary and old school house sounds.
As well as ‘Fibre’ Habbo showcases his trade at ‘Mission 2’ and ‘The Backroom’ both in Leeds and has lined up at ‘Missolua’ in Doncaster, Venus in Manchester and ‘CoCo Tang’ in Nottingham all this only adding to his diversity as a DJ.

A skilled club DJ Habbo has also dared to test his skills at Festivals such as ‘Made In Leeds festival’ and renowned super parties like the ‘Court Yard Party’ in Leeds of which he is now a permanent resident. 

As well as gracing the British Isles Habbo has followed in his father’s footsteps and broken into Ibiza the playground of any successful Dance DJ having  performed at ‘Savhannas’ at the “Sunset Beach House set”.
This has only helped him hone his musical talent and production skills, these skills are demonstrated not only in his live performances but in his collection of online mixes open to the public. His mixes are among some of the most frequently visited on soundcloud and a true testament to his mixing prowess, beat matching  and taste in  great music from a variety of genres.

For his age DJ Habbo Fox is the complete performer and live DJ and soon to be the name on everybody’s set list. Sighting friend of the family ‘Roger Sanchez’ as his inspiration as a DJ all his fans and all that know him has high hopes.
Looking to build on an already prosperous career Habbo is looking to increase his residencies home and abroad and is available for private hire.

GIRL FROM BERLIN.
__________________________

In times of an already vast ‘Soundcloud-Generation, that is continuously growing and bringing forth new and highly ambitious DJ’s, it is certainly not easy to separate yourself from the herd. However, the search for individuality and exhilarating mix between a casual mood and a breeze of the past decades brings us straight to the music of a talented young artist: introducing, LOVRA.

Being born in the German provinces, Laura discovered her love for music in her early childhood. Her excellent sense in rhythm and her affinity for aesthetical movements brought her to into the world of ballet on a very young age. The following years Laura her enthusiasm towards sounds and tones peaked and slipped its way into her professional career path and enabled her to express her versatile creativity.

After studies in Design, Laura moved to Berlin. The German capital finally gave Laura the creative environment she was looking for. In the epicentre of the artistic freedom she found new impulses and ideas for her music, making the move to Berlin one of the best decisions in her life.

As a successful graphic designer, model and recently music producer, Laura bundles her creative activities under her artistic name LOVRA. LOVRA is a free spirit who has given herself the objective to unite her passion and vocation in a magical/wondrous way. Just recently she has signed her first major deal and couldn’t be any happier with the growing positive feedback of her followers: “Berlin is a very open-minded city. To be able to meet and learn from inspiring new people on a daily basis and to be introduced to their opinions and perspectives is something that means a lot to me!”

By combining her attraction towards music from the eighties and nineties and her natural feeling for modern melodies, LOVRA creates her own distinctive sound. Her tracks, full with groovy House-tunes, striking vocals and danceable beats, will reverberate in our ears for a long time.
LOVRA, who keeps reinventing herself with every gig she plays and every track she makes, carries us away with unparalleled sound spheres. Driven by the curiosity for new beats and wanting to give the music of the past decades a loving homage, LOVRA is well on track. With her remake of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On” and her own creations, she already gave us and her crowd some wonderful moments. We are very much looking forward to a thrilling career and to an artist that has earned the right to be called “unique” more than anyone else.

THE FUNK HUNTERS
@WestwoodRecordings | Canada


The Funk Hunters are one of Canada’s top breakout acts, gaining accolades from all corners of the electronic music scene and pushing boundaries with the constant evolution of their live stage show featuring custom synched visuals and a LIVE 6-piece band. Nick Middleton and Duncan Smith have redefined their sound, bridging the gap between electronic and live music. Originally carving out a name for themselves by reviving and remixing rare classics, their focus has turned to creating original compositions and collaborating with world class musicians and vocalists both in the studio and on stage. Combining the melody and emotion of funk and soul with the grit and heavy punch of electronic drums and basslines, The Funk Hunters signature sound has been selling out venues across the country and leading them on tours around the world. During live shows, their 4-turntable Audio Visual set now shares the stage with a full band including live vocals, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, keys and drums.

The Funk Hunters have had a busy year and it’s no wonder why. Managing and producing music for their own imprint/record label ‘Westwood Recordings,’ coupled with their North American, European, Australian and New Zealand tours, the duo burst into the international music spotlight in 2012 and quickly gained momentum worldwide. Integrating a custom synced video set with live musicians is not only visually captivating but is pushing the boundaries of performance innovation. Awing audiences with their acclaimed audio visual show, The Funk Hunters Live set is charismatic, energetic and ambitious with no signs of slowing down. If you haven’t already, it might be time to get captured by the funk.

Bio:
Anthony Palacio Stringer, born in New York, U.S.A and raised in Armenia and Medellin, Colombia. Anthony since age of 7 had musical dreams, but it all started with his father having a guitar, and his mother singing and playing melodic songs, after that, Tony had always liked music allot, but mostly melodic music, since then in the year of 2000, he began listening to Tiesto, Gigi´D Agostino, and Armin Van Buuren, Old trance music, but since years went by, he wanted more melodic songs, but with a little bit of hard bass on it. In the days of 2006 started to listen to House music, Tech House, Techno, And Minimal, And as soon he heard, He started to like very much Electro House, but only melodic, his world is just full of melody´s, ideas, etc...But there is only one genre that he mostly felt in the right place, in the days of 2007 heard for the first time, Progressive House. After that, this genre rocked his world out crazy, he started to gather many ideas, recording the ideas, placing the ideas and mixing it with his imagination, at that time, he always was looking one way to remember this things, and that’s how when he got into Musical Production, But he never had time…until 2011 came by, Tony grew up with a larger imagination, bigger thoughts, but mostly...Had The Musical Feeling, By that time he said to himself that it was time to go forward and not look back, In February of 2011 started Dj classes at Dj Zentral, had gained more experience from Noizzer A.K.A Dagroovemakers And Ethereal Mist, Mauro Pierotti, And Boom Cardona (Cut Knob). After the days gone by, he thought that he should make a bigger step forward, and the step was to become a Producer. He never took classes, he never paid musical college or etc...But others have helped him with advices, tips, mostly Such as Leo Guerrero, Smokers-Area, and Jonnas B. After that, everything started to sound rookie, but with experience that life gives, he started to sound more professional, until then...He became a Producer. When he knew everything now, he started to remember all ideas, feelings, and thoughts, that’s when he became on more Progressive House, and Electro House Music producer, and until now...Tony Stringer is now a dropping bass melodic Progressive House and Electro House music.

On a mission to enrapture crowds, Auto dominates across the entire palpitating bass subspecies. Emmanuel, the brain behind the bombs, comes alive all over the city and beyond – fearlessly stepping up to the plate with an arsenal of dark screaming synths and super quick mixes across diverse genres, it’s become a well-accepted reputation.

While honing his craft for the past 10 years, his time behind the decks has shaken the scene in Sydney town and beyond, standing out from the throng of Sydney Bass DJ’s to gain residency at Chinese Laundry, where he pushes the bass envelope at BASSIC & BOSS BASS events.

From those nightclub blow-outs to thumping outdoor stages, Autoclaws can scream as much as he likes, deservedly in demand at one of the world’s strongest festivals - DEFQON.1. With his unique style he’s performed 4 years and gained solid respect across the people.

Sydney knows well and so should you - bass music comes in many forms, but if you like it loud and heavy there’s only one place to look locally - with Autoclaws.

Though they formed less than a year ago, the Buffalo-based DJ/production duo comprised of Ryan Sinatra and Jake Broffman have already proven they’re a force to be reckoned with. They’ve got an EDM.com release and a performance at Webster Hall in NYC under their belt and have already garnered the support of Destructo, Griz, Henry Fong, Wuki and the Chainsmokers, to name a few. Expect Dusty Bits to continue pushing the envelope in dance music and amping up your squad in the nights to come.

All enquiries: diverofficial@gmail.com

Sign up for my mailing list: http://bit.ly/1k8fitV

Diver was born long ago in the mythical subaquatic city of Atlantis. He spent his childhood in a state of blissful ignorance within the silent underwater city, floating happily amid its Art Deco coral reef palaces, unaware that a world of sound lay awaiting him beyond the muted stillness of the ocean depths. And then, one fateful day twenty thousand leagues under the sea, Diver encountered Jacques Cousteau, who bestowed two gifts upon him: a pair of headphones and an inexhaustible diving cylinder.

Diver's world had been transformed! For the first time, he heard music; for the first time, he could dance. Donning his magic scuba set, Diver set off on a journey which would last decades and which would transport him to bodies of water across the globe--from the warm Guanabara Bay of 1960s Rio de Janeiro Bossa Nova, to the murky Hudson River of 1970s & 1980s New York City Disco, to the azure Mediterranean of 1990s & 2000s French Touch and Tropical House.

Until, finally, in 2013, Diver removed his magic scuba gear and replaced it with magic DJ gear, ready to present his unique, contemporary sound mixing Deep House, Nu-Disco, Indie Dance and French House to the world.",197,29,,,,,4

DJ JUN (JPN),,http://soundcloud.com/krushgroove,krush.groove@hotmail.co.,"BOOKING : krush.groove@hotmail.co.jp
FACEBOOK :https://www.facebook.com/djjun.jp
TWITTER : https://twitter.com/jcbjun


One of the most prominent DJs, DJ JUN, was fascinated by lots of records filled with passionate and creative music.
JUN naturally intended to play since he had been coming in touch with many different kinds of music from childhood.
After he regularly started his career in Osaka in the latter half of 90's, he moved back to his home Okayama and has been offered to spin at the primary clubs not just all over Japan, but overseas-Marquee NY, Q Bar Bangkok, Lotus and Ka Hawaii and more as a guest.
Also JUN promotes his own party and has taken an active part in PR events of fashion brands, fashion shows, home parties organized by celebrities.  He's been spinning with lots of world-famous artists and been highly evaluated so far, and PETE ROCK much extremely praised him ''YOU ARE CLASSIC!!''
DJ JUN got greatly influenced by the world legend artists-Kid Capri, Red Alert and DJ AM, and his style of djing based on them with his fantastic individuality. He's been rocking with his massive knowledge and good taste in mixing.
In spite of a local artist, also Jun becomes highly evaluated with his concept MIX series ''Krush Groove'' ''Bust A Move'' ''TO THE SEA!!'' ''FUTURE ROOFTOP''.
Today Jun is one of the most prospective DJs in the world.",349,5,,,,,4

The Tallinn, Estonia based DJ fuses the rich legacy of UK bass science with the beat alchemy of Angolan Kuduro and other „New World“ genres , establishing a trans-national, hyper-hybrid sound that directs towards the future.

In his hometown Tallinn, Estonia, Bert Prikenfeld has been a househould name since the mid 1990s. Starting his career as DJ 
Critikal, Bert soon became Estonia´s Nr.1 hip hop DJ, playing various club shows every week, and starting to produce his own cuts. Bert soon moved to Drum n´Bass and released his first album in 1999 which was critically acclaimed in Estonia and Finland.  
 
Throughtout the 00s, Critikal forged his sound engineering skills in productions for various Finnish and Estonian music projects and proceeded musically to early dub step and Baltimore club and the Rio Baile Funk compilations and releases of Berlin DJ and Man Recordings head Daniel Haaksman. When Haaksman initiated a remix contest for his track „Kid Conga“ in 2009, Bert provided a remix under his new moniker Bert On Beats. Haaksman immediately recognised the production quality of Bert´s remix contest contribution and it became the winning remix. Soon Haaksman asked for more tracks by Bert On Beats and he was impressed by the fresh approach that Bert showed in fusing dubstep basslines with the in-your-face aesthetic of Jump Up Drum n´Bass and the wave of new, „ghetto“ genres like Kuduro, Baile Funk or Soca. 
 
In between his single releases, remixes followed for Vybz Kartel, Buraka Som Sistema, Rudimental, Ku Bo, Gotan Project or Gaudi. His tracks currently get support from world class DJs such as ToddlaT, Burns, FatBoySlim, Sinden, Brodinski, Diplo, DropTheLime, Feadz, Foaomo or Douster amongst others.",7714,69,,,,,13
