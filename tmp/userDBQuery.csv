The new royalty rates apply to EVERY COMMERCIAL BROADCASTER at .0017 per performance. If you had 1000 listeners on at all times, each song would cost you $1.70 to play. If you play 15 songs an hour, the royalties alone are $25.50 an HOUR! That's $612.00 per DAY and $223,380.00 per year.

Artist BIO 

James Martin

For James Martin, Discovering Electronic music in dark clubs at the impressionable age of 20 seemed a natural progression for a kid escaping the small town normalcies of rural New Zealand.
Hearing Craig Richards play shortly after the release of fabric 01 was a discovery and turning point for James and helped to shape the next ten years of collecting and producing.
Indeed Those early impressions still have an effect today. With over a decade of djing (and more recently producing) James still draws on the same sense of other worldly, deep and thoughtful music.

""My style can go from slow and dreamy to trippy and dark, but always with a narrative. Aimed at being evocative as much as it is to moving a dancefloor.""
Fast forward to 2005 where  James Co- Founded Auckland’s popular and still running club night SONIKTONIK alongside French maestro Cyril Orson which furthered his experience in the booth. Playing alongside the likes of DJ T, Mike Monday, Antix & Fiord, Dick Johnson, Greg Churchill and Simon flower to  a few.
A move to Melbourne in 2009 led to a long standing residency ""DE:TUNED"" at Melbourne’s now infamous Killing time with his partners in Crime, Aaron Stringer and Rhys Roberts.
 Most recently James has been spending alot of time in the studio and has had some success with  his debut track ""Lovebirds"" on Curl Curl records gaining praise and plays alike from the likes of MotorcitySoul stalwart Matthias Vogt, Makossa, Yoko0 and Arnaldo [Smallville]. With another EP in the pipeline  the future looks bright, in dark clubs.

SÄX,,http://soundcloud.com/saxmusic,bookings@sax.fi,"Mix a smooth saxophonist and a f*cked up DJ. Give the palette to Grizzly. Get the SÄXperience.

Contact: bookings@sax.fi

BIO:

“SÄX is a scientific experiment first launched when Andy Skädäm, a notorious saxophonist, found his long lost brother, a f*cked up DJ by the name of DJ Skittl3s. With his powers as a functioning alcoholic, Skittl3s reached out to their oldest brother Grizzly in order to ignore the boundaries and produce independent music without limits. After a few days of heavy idealism, SÄX was born, bringing you a combination of saxophonic vibes and messed up sounds, also known as the SÄXperience.

The rumours of the first SÄXperiences lead to the ancient city of Turku, Finland, and the first physical culmination is the EP ""Broadcasting in Paris"" released in May 2013. Why Paris? It has been said that Skädäm was a part of the French Revolution, that is all we know. The SÄXperience is a constantly changing phenomenon and a never-ending journey. Too deep? In other words, it is the shit.

We are SÄX, friends for life, brothers forever. Join the family.”",1402,30,,,,

Sickonce I Gijoe,Gijoe Sickonce,http://soundcloud.com/sickonce,gijoe@kimahera.pt,"DJs that are also producers. Now there's a line rarer than you might think in hip hop, both in and out of Portugal. Jazzy Jeff is one of the first serious references for that. And then there's the unbeatable DJ Premier. Or DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist. But most of them devote themselves exclusively to one or the other art. Kanye is seen mainly as a producer, as Mixmaster Mike is seen first of all as a DJ as the Beastie Boys will gladly confirm. GI Joe is DJ. And Sickonce is producer. Except that, unlike the other examples, GI Joe and Sickonce are also one and the same person.
Rafael Correia is the name behind the alter-egos, an architect by profession and arch-enemy of the music without groove, without punch or sharp kick and snare drums. This native of Portimão has been an early - late 90s! - active member of the singular hip hop scene in Algarve, with a curriculum that extends from Twism to Tribruto, and this just to name projects his been involved with at the most southern region of the country.
As a DJ, however, GI Joe has not been limited to scratching for others - besides the ones mentioned, we  can also find his precise cuts with a great flow in Royalistick and Reflect albums, for example - but he is also known to give extra work to clubs’ sound systems  all over the country. In the dj booth, the work of GI Joe is equally eclectic, always looking for the latest 'banger' able to stir crowds with an open style where hip hop meets dubstep, and where good taste reigns forever. Clear example: the duo Bass Avenue that he shares with Kombo and who explore the lowest spectrum of frequencies thought to the clubs.
On the reverse of this medal is working as Sickonce. Obviously, each influences the other facets: when the eyes see the dance floor almost always conclude what works, what bass lines do move the bodies, which sounds awaken the best reactions in people. And this privileged vantage point of the DJ is then transported to the studio where all these findings are put into operation. Sickonce produces beats that are unique, powerful, with a careful sound and wide open views. The latest example is his extremely well taken care of production work on the album Deep: her, a project that he keeps with emmy Curl and which has just premiered in album format. But Sickonce has a wider discography, including the mega-project Palavra de Músico, which ventured into the production of more than fifty tracks with various guests. A milestone for the 'do it yourself' spirit in national hip hop.
GI Joe and Sickonce, incidentally, are two identities associated with one of the most active cells of hip hop in Algarve and nationally, Kimahera, house of ambitious projects, with a particular  identity that counts several years of existence and that has done much to keep hip hop music on the map nationally. Rafael is one of minds behind Kimahera.
In common, GI Joe, Sickonce and, why not?, Architect Rafael Correa have a passion for solid and fluid building, be that a set grounded in classics but with a distinctly modern touch, beats that are underpinned by a strong rhythmic foundation, or buildings of brick and cement built to last generations. That’s the only way to build the future. That of music and that of the country.

Bio
In the last 4 years Habbo Foxx has accomplished the sometimes impossible for any DJ. 
That mammoth task is to earn a reputation and become established in large competitive cities like Leeds, Doncaster, Manchester and Nottingham.
Dance music you could say is in Habbo’s blood, with a family dynasty of musicians his sister a renowned percussionist and his farther the legendary PAV on Percussion.
A worldwide musician PAV has played with some of the globes biggest DJs in a career spanning  15 years, this has enabled a  young Habbo to learn the tricks of the trade and finely tune his musical ear to make him one of the north’s most reputable, reliable and up and coming DJs.

Habbo has held a residency at ‘Bar Fibre’ in Leeds for over 3 years and continues to entertain the masses on a weekly basis. This is done by not only giving crowds what they desire but always changing up the game with his signature sound of contemporary and old school house sounds.
As well as ‘Fibre’ Habbo showcases his trade at ‘Mission 2’ and ‘The Backroom’ both in Leeds and has lined up at ‘Missolua’ in Doncaster, Venus in Manchester and ‘CoCo Tang’ in Nottingham all this only adding to his diversity as a DJ.

A skilled club DJ Habbo has also dared to test his skills at Festivals such as ‘Made In Leeds festival’ and renowned super parties like the ‘Court Yard Party’ in Leeds of which he is now a permanent resident. 

As well as gracing the British Isles Habbo has followed in his father’s footsteps and broken into Ibiza the playground of any successful Dance DJ having  performed at ‘Savhannas’ at the “Sunset Beach House set”.
This has only helped him hone his musical talent and production skills, these skills are demonstrated not only in his live performances but in his collection of online mixes open to the public. His mixes are among some of the most frequently visited on soundcloud and a true testament to his mixing prowess, beat matching  and taste in  great music from a variety of genres.

For his age DJ Habbo Fox is the complete performer and live DJ and soon to be the name on everybody’s set list. Sighting friend of the family ‘Roger Sanchez’ as his inspiration as a DJ all his fans and all that know him has high hopes.

I’ve been making mashups for over a year now. During my senior year in high school, I decided to give music and DJing a try and won the first edition of the “I am the Third Party” competition by London’s EDM giants Third Party. If I won recognition by them, I couldn’t suck that much right? Anyways, I went all conservative and got into med school. There I realized life is all about doing what you love, and Progressive House became an essential part of who I am. I did two semesters and dropped out. 2 weeks out of college, I got my own show at local radio station Be997 (Which also hosts Ryan Seacrest and Pete Tong!)

I studied EDM music production and am now doing my weekly radio show “This Is Gianmarco Morales” and making my own tracks and remixes. I’m trusting my gut and pursuing my dream.

I’m Gianmarco Morales, 20 years old, and I hope to become successful doing what I love.

Enjoy my music!

#THISISGM,Gianmarco Morales,http://soundcloud.com/tagthisisgm,info@gianmarcomorales.com,"Apparently every Soundcloud page needs a fancy bio written in third person narrating the life of its user. Stating their amazing talent and why people should hire them yesterday. Saying stuff like “Jeremy Jeremyson started making music coming out his mother’s vagina, the doctor slapped his ass and a majestic cry in C-minor inspired the world to become a better place.” C’mon people, here’s my story.

I’ve been making mashups for over a year now. During my senior year in high school, I decided to give music and DJing a try and won the first edition of the “I am the Third Party” competition by London’s EDM giants Third Party. If I won recognition by them, I couldn’t suck that much right? Anyways, I went all conservative and got into med school. There I realized life is all about doing what you love, and Progressive House became an essential part of who I am. I did two semesters and dropped out. 2 weeks out of college, I got my own show at local radio station Be997 (Which also hosts Ryan Seacrest and Pete Tong!)

I studied EDM music production and am now doing my weekly radio show “This Is Gianmarco Morales” and making my own tracks and remixes. I’m trusting my gut and pursuing my dream.

I would finish school and while other kids where playing video games I would be at my local record store going through this weeks releases. Playing street parties I quickly caught the ears of  promoters and moved into bars & nightclubs, this opportunity gave me the pleasure of playing regularly in some of Australia's biggest nightclubs. 

These days my love for music is as strong if not stronger then my days early in my career.  

Soundcloud is the prefect platform for me to spread the love of music only way I know how to.

GIRL FROM BERLIN.
__________________________

In times of an already vast ‘Soundcloud-Generation, that is continuously growing and bringing forth new and highly ambitious DJ’s, it is certainly not easy to separate yourself from the herd. However, the search for individuality and exhilarating mix between a casual mood and a breeze of the past decades brings us straight to the music of a talented young artist: introducing, LOVRA.

Being born in the German provinces, Laura discovered her love for music in her early childhood. Her excellent sense in rhythm and her affinity for aesthetical movements brought her to into the world of ballet on a very young age. The following years Laura her enthusiasm towards sounds and tones peaked and slipped its way into her professional career path and enabled her to express her versatile creativity.

After studies in Design, Laura moved to Berlin. The German capital finally gave Laura the creative environment she was looking for. In the epicentre of the artistic freedom she found new impulses and ideas for her music, making the move to Berlin one of the best decisions in her life.

As a successful graphic designer, model and recently music producer, Laura bundles her creative activities under her artistic name LOVRA. LOVRA is a free spirit who has given herself the objective to unite her passion and vocation in a magical/wondrous way. Just recently she has signed her first major deal and couldn’t be any happier with the growing positive feedback of her followers: “Berlin is a very open-minded city. To be able to meet and learn from inspiring new people on a daily basis and to be introduced to their opinions and perspectives is something that means a lot to me!”

By combining her attraction towards music from the eighties and nineties and her natural feeling for modern melodies, LOVRA creates her own distinctive sound. Her tracks, full with groovy House-tunes, striking vocals and danceable beats, will reverberate in our ears for a long time.
LOVRA, who keeps reinventing herself with every gig she plays and every track she makes, carries us away with unparalleled sound spheres. Driven by the curiosity for new beats and wanting to give the music of the past decades a loving homage, LOVRA is well on track. With her remake of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On” and her own creations, she already gave us and her crowd some wonderful moments. We are very much looking forward to a thrilling career and to an artist that has earned the right to be called “unique” more than anyone else.

Bio:
Anthony Palacio Stringer, born in New York, U.S.A and raised in Armenia and Medellin, Colombia. Anthony since age of 7 had musical dreams, but it all started with his father having a guitar, and his mother singing and playing melodic songs, after that, Tony had always liked music allot, but mostly melodic music, since then in the year of 2000, he began listening to Tiesto, Gigi´D Agostino, and Armin Van Buuren, Old trance music, but since years went by, he wanted more melodic songs, but with a little bit of hard bass on it. In the days of 2006 started to listen to House music, Tech House, Techno, And Minimal, And as soon he heard, He started to like very much Electro House, but only melodic, his world is just full of melody´s, ideas, etc...But there is only one genre that he mostly felt in the right place, in the days of 2007 heard for the first time, Progressive House. After that, this genre rocked his world out crazy, he started to gather many ideas, recording the ideas, placing the ideas and mixing it with his imagination, at that time, he always was looking one way to remember this things, and that’s how when he got into Musical Production, But he never had time…until 2011 came by, Tony grew up with a larger imagination, bigger thoughts, but mostly...Had The Musical Feeling, By that time he said to himself that it was time to go forward and not look back, In February of 2011 started Dj classes at Dj Zentral, had gained more experience from Noizzer A.K.A Dagroovemakers And Ethereal Mist, Mauro Pierotti, And Boom Cardona (Cut Knob). After the days gone by, he thought that he should make a bigger step forward, and the step was to become a Producer. He never took classes, he never paid musical college or etc...But others have helped him with advices, tips, mostly Such as Leo Guerrero, Smokers-Area, and Jonnas B. After that, everything started to sound rookie, but with experience that life gives, he started to sound more professional, until then...He became a Producer. When he knew everything now, he started to remember all ideas, feelings, and thoughts, that’s when he became on more Progressive House, and Electro House Music producer, and until now...Tony Stringer is now a dropping bass melodic Progressive House and Electro House music. All the imagination, feelings, and thoughts he had since a boy…He has it in one single computer now.",769,68,,,,

THE FUNK HUNTERS
@WestwoodRecordings | Canada


The Funk Hunters are one of Canada’s top breakout acts, gaining accolades from all corners of the electronic music scene and pushing boundaries with the constant evolution of their live stage show featuring custom synched visuals and a LIVE 6-piece band. Nick Middleton and Duncan Smith have redefined their sound, bridging the gap between electronic and live music. Originally carving out a name for themselves by reviving and remixing rare classics, their focus has turned to creating original compositions and collaborating with world class musicians and vocalists both in the studio and on stage. Combining the melody and emotion of funk and soul with the grit and heavy punch of electronic drums and basslines, The Funk Hunters signature sound has been selling out venues across the country and leading them on tours around the world. During live shows, their 4-turntable Audio Visual set now shares the stage with a full band including live vocals, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, keys and drums.

The Funk Hunters have had a busy year and it’s no wonder why. Managing and producing music for their own imprint/record label ‘Westwood Recordings,’ coupled with their North American, European, Australian and New Zealand tours, the duo burst into the international music spotlight in 2012 and quickly gained momentum worldwide. Integrating a custom synced video set with live musicians is not only visually captivating but is pushing the boundaries of performance innovation. Awing audiences with their acclaimed audio visual show, The Funk Hunters Live set is charismatic, energetic and ambitious with no signs of slowing down. If you haven’t already, it might be time to get captured by the funk.

Autoclaws,,http://soundcloud.com/autoclaws,autoclaws@gmail.com,"Crankin’ heavy basslines are only one part of the deal with Sydney based badman Autoclaws. On a mission to enrapture crowds, Auto dominates across the entire palpitating bass subspecies. Emmanuel, the brain behind the bombs, comes alive all over the city and beyond – fearlessly stepping up to the plate with an arsenal of dark screaming synths and super quick mixes across diverse genres, it’s become a well-accepted reputation.

While honing his craft for the past 10 years, his time behind the decks has shaken the scene in Sydney town and beyond, standing out from the throng of Sydney Bass DJ’s to gain residency at Chinese Laundry, where he pushes the bass envelope at BASSIC & BOSS BASS events.

From those nightclub blow-outs to thumping outdoor stages, Autoclaws can scream as much as he likes, deservedly in demand at one of the world’s strongest festivals - DEFQON.1. With his unique style he’s performed 4 years and gained solid respect across the people.

Sydney knows well and so should you - bass music comes in many forms, but if you like it loud and heavy there’s only one place to look locally - with Autoclaws.

Dusty Bits,,http://soundcloud.com/dusty-bits,dustybitsmusic@gmail.com,"When Notixx’s heavy bass aesthetic collided with Brother Bear’s booty music, something beautiful happened. Dusty Bits emerged as a healthy hybrid of bass house and breaks with eclectic influences varying from Baltimore club to dubstep, breaking down the barriers of bass music as we know it. Though they formed less than a year ago, the Buffalo-based DJ/production duo comprised of Ryan Sinatra and Jake Broffman have already proven they’re a force to be reckoned with. They’ve got an EDM.com release and a performance at Webster Hall in NYC under their belt and have already garnered the support of Destructo, Griz, Henry Fong, Wuki and the Chainsmokers, to name a few. Expect Dusty Bits to continue pushing the envelope in dance music and amping up your squad in the nights to come.

Sign up for my mailing list: http://bit.ly/1k8fitV

Diver was born long ago in the mythical subaquatic city of Atlantis. He spent his childhood in a state of blissful ignorance within the silent underwater city, floating happily amid its Art Deco coral reef palaces, unaware that a world of sound lay awaiting him beyond the muted stillness of the ocean depths. And then, one fateful day twenty thousand leagues under the sea, Diver encountered Jacques Cousteau, who bestowed two gifts upon him: a pair of headphones and an inexhaustible diving cylinder.

Diver's world had been transformed! For the first time, he heard music; for the first time, he could dance. Donning his magic scuba set, Diver set off on a journey which would last decades and which would transport him to bodies of water across the globe--from the warm Guanabara Bay of 1960s Rio de Janeiro Bossa Nova, to the murky Hudson River of 1970s & 1980s New York City Disco, to the azure Mediterranean of 1990s & 2000s French Touch and Tropical House.

Until, finally, in 2013, Diver removed his magic scuba gear and replaced it with magic DJ gear, ready to present his unique, contemporary sound mixing Deep House, Nu-Disco, Indie Dance and French House to the world.",197,29,,,,

TWITTER : https://twitter.com/jcbjun


One of the most prominent DJs, DJ JUN, was fascinated by lots of records filled with passionate and creative music.
JUN naturally intended to play since he had been coming in touch with many different kinds of music from childhood.
After he regularly started his career in Osaka in the latter half of 90's, he moved back to his home Okayama and has been offered to spin at the primary clubs not just all over Japan, but overseas-Marquee NY, Q Bar Bangkok, Lotus and Ka Hawaii and more as a guest.
Also JUN promotes his own party and has taken an active part in PR events of fashion brands, fashion shows, home parties organized by celebrities.  He's been spinning with lots of world-famous artists and been highly evaluated so far, and PETE ROCK much extremely praised him ''YOU ARE CLASSIC!!''
DJ JUN got greatly influenced by the world legend artists-Kid Capri, Red Alert and DJ AM, and his style of djing based on them with his fantastic individuality. He's been rocking with his massive knowledge and good taste in mixing.
In spite of a local artist, also Jun becomes highly evaluated with his concept MIX series ''Krush Groove'' ''Bust A Move'' ''TO THE SEA!!'' ''FUTURE ROOFTOP''.
Today Jun is one of the most prospective DJs in the world.",349,5,,,,

The Tallinn, Estonia based DJ fuses the rich legacy of UK bass science with the beat alchemy of Angolan Kuduro and other „New World“ genres , establishing a trans-national, hyper-hybrid sound that directs towards the future.

In his hometown Tallinn, Estonia, Bert Prikenfeld has been a househould name since the mid 1990s. Starting his career as DJ 
Critikal, Bert soon became Estonia´s Nr.1 hip hop DJ, playing various club shows every week, and starting to produce his own cuts. Bert soon moved to Drum n´Bass and released his first album in 1999 which was critically acclaimed in Estonia and Finland.  
 
Throughtout the 00s, Critikal forged his sound engineering skills in productions for various Finnish and Estonian music projects and proceeded musically to early dub step and Baltimore club and the Rio Baile Funk compilations and releases of Berlin DJ and Man Recordings head Daniel Haaksman. When Haaksman initiated a remix contest for his track „Kid Conga“ in 2009, Bert provided a remix under his new moniker Bert On Beats. Haaksman immediately recognised the production quality of Bert´s remix contest contribution and it became the winning remix. Soon Haaksman asked for more tracks by Bert On Beats and he was impressed by the fresh approach that Bert showed in fusing dubstep basslines with the in-your-face aesthetic of Jump Up Drum n´Bass and the wave of new, „ghetto“ genres like Kuduro, Baile Funk or Soca. 
 
In between his single releases, remixes followed for Vybz Kartel, Buraka Som Sistema, Rudimental, Ku Bo, Gotan Project or Gaudi. His tracks currently get support from world class DJs such as ToddlaT, Burns, FatBoySlim, Sinden, Brodinski, Diplo, DropTheLime, Feadz, Foaomo or Douster amongst others.",7715,69,,,,

The Tallinn, Estonia based DJ fuses the rich legacy of UK bass science with the beat alchemy of Angolan Kuduro and other „New World“ genres , establishing a trans-national, hyper-hybrid sound that directs towards the future.

In his hometown Tallinn, Estonia, Bert Prikenfeld has been a househould name since the mid 1990s. Starting his career as DJ 
Critikal, Bert soon became Estonia´s Nr.1 hip hop DJ, playing various club shows every week, and starting to produce his own cuts. Bert soon moved to Drum n´Bass and released his first album in 1999 which was critically acclaimed in Estonia and Finland.  
 
Throughtout the 00s, Critikal forged his sound engineering skills in productions for various Finnish and Estonian music projects and proceeded musically to early dub step and Baltimore club and the Rio Baile Funk compilations and releases of Berlin DJ and Man Recordings head Daniel Haaksman. When Haaksman initiated a remix contest for his track „Kid Conga“ in 2009, Bert provided a remix under his new moniker Bert On Beats. Haaksman immediately recognised the production quality of Bert´s remix contest contribution and it became the winning remix. Soon Haaksman asked for more tracks by Bert On Beats and he was impressed by the fresh approach that Bert showed in fusing dubstep basslines with the in-your-face aesthetic of Jump Up Drum n´Bass and the wave of new, „ghetto“ genres like Kuduro, Baile Funk or Soca. 
 
In between his single releases, remixes followed for Vybz Kartel, Buraka Som Sistema, Rudimental, Ku Bo, Gotan Project or Gaudi. His tracks currently get support from world class DJs such as ToddlaT, Burns, FatBoySlim, Sinden, Brodinski, Diplo, DropTheLime, Feadz, Foaomo or Douster amongst others.",7715,69,,,,

In 2008 Dylan Rozhon was known more commonly as Sikkamorr, performing his own diverse style of intellectual hiphop and trip hop in the greater sacramento area. as time progressed and as patterns in his life started to emerge he found a new niche in the bass music community, having produced his own beatwork for some time he was entranced by the psychadelic experience that was Electronic music.Over the last 4 years he has undertaken many aliases, all leading to his newest creation. L.F.Ogre. in keeping up with tradition,he has  kept his hiphop roots well tangled in his music, which is apparent in most of his art now, using samples from a diverse (and sometimes obscure) selection of music ranging from jazz to ragtime and reggae alongside sinister and elaborate synthwork, focusing on heavy bass tones and complex percussion. He has had the honor of sharing the stage with many accomplished djs and producers in the northern california music industry, including Bassex and Ratchet, to name a few. Well known for his explosive live sets and ghoulish basslines, L.F.Ogre has been compared to a myriad of different artists, such as Datsik, Rattatat, Pretty Lights, and Savant, to name a few, and rarely fails to bring the bass when requested.

Holly Drummond,Holly Drummond,http://soundcloud.com/hollydrummond,info@hollydrummond.com,"21 Year Old Scottish Singer/Songwriter and EDM Vocalist.
Contact: info@hollydrummond.com

  Holly Drummond has been described as a “female Damien Rice”. The 21 year old singer/songwriter from Edinburgh started showcasing her music to the world at the age of 15 when she started posting videos onto YouTube. It was her cover of “Alejandro” by Lady Gaga that attracted over 150,000 views, gaining her hundreds of fans and kick starting her music career.

  Since then, Holly has released four EPs. The three most recent - Cloud Nine, In the Dark and Diving In - are available on iTunes. The lead track of In the Dark, 'These Four Walls', has been featured in a few episodes of the UK TV show Hollyoaks. When Cloud Nine was released in 2012 it charted at number 10 in the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart, attracting attention from iTunes who labelled it as 'New and Noteworthy'.

  Holly takes inspiration from artists such as Imogen Heap, Daughter, Lucy Rose, Regina Spektor and many others. Her sound has been compared to the likes of Dido, Suzanne Vega, Nick Drake and Lucy Rose, with a touch of Paramore. Holly’s lyrics have been described as “humble and wise beyond her years”.

  Holly Drummond’s talent for writing has seen her win the Burnsong Under 21 Singer/Songwriter Award and also be nominated for The Forth One To Watch Award. As well as writing and playing all the instruments on her tracks (including cello), she records, mixes and produces them all herself in her own bedroom studio.

  In addition to writing her own original songs, Holly Drummond writes and records vocals for Electronic Dance Music artists. Holly has worked with promising producers such as Direct, Rameses B, Eminence, TwoThirds, Elliot Berger and many others. She has had releases on the large Canadian EDM label Monstercat which have charted at Number 1 in the iTunes Albums Chart.

  Through her collaborations with many other artists and her own videos, Holly has racked up an impressive total of over 4 million views on YouTube. As well as her EDM collaborations, Holly has worked with other singer/songwriters such as Lewis Mokler, Frank Hamilton and fellow Scot, Danny Shah.

  Holly is currently working on a new EP which is due to be released later in 2015.",11458,65,,,,

Kike Rivero,Kike Rivero,http://soundcloud.com/kikerivero,kabaret@hotmail.es,"Nacido en el corazón de La mancha.

Desde muy joven ya llevaba el ritmo dentro de el por lo que le llamaba la atención todo lo que tuviese que ver con la música y eso le hacía diferente al resto de los niños de su edad.
En el año 1992 tuvo su primera oportunidad y no la desaprovecho en absoluto ya que llego a ser uno de los Djs mas destacados de toda la Zona por su perseverancia y por su gusto musical a su corta edad,tal fue su repercusión que llego a trabajar con un grupo de animación con el cual recorrió medio País y teniendo como compañeros de cabina durante 4 años a Carlos Jean y a Jimmy(Chicago – USA).

Dichos años le vinieron muy bien para descubrir sonidos nuevos pero siempre con un estilo propio dentro de la música electrónica,esos eran y son los sonidos mas frescos dentro de el “HOUSE” con una seña de identidad…mucho “GROOVE”!!

Es un Dj que no se encasilla en un solo estilo y se adapta a La Sala o Festival,en sus Sets puedes encontar : Deep-house  / House / Tech-house / Nu Disco / Soulful / Chill

En el año 2011 decidió cumplir uno de sus sueños creando su promotora de Eventos llamada Kabaret .Funk con la cual solo se pretendía realizar unos pocos eventos reuniendo a algunos Djs amigos repartiendo esos eventos en pequeñas Salas de su Ciudad,al final el sueño se hizo magia siendo lo que a terminado dándole ese pequeño empujón que le faltaba realizando y colaborando en eventos de la altura de :  

Matinee World Tour Ciudad Real -  Gira 40 Principales Castilla La Mancha 2012 2013 y 2014 - Gira MaximaFm Castilla La Mancha 2012 2013 y 2014 -  Bora-Bora Ibiza 2013 – Estadio Santiago Bernabeu (Madrid) – New Garamond (Madrid) – VOG (Madrid) – Joy Slava (Madrid) – Sala D’Time (Málaga) – ViñaRock 2014/15 y un largo etc…

En Abril 2014 sacó su primera producción llamada Ibiza Best junto a su gran compañero de estudio KPD (KPD trabaja para sellos como Defected - Pacha Recordings – Heavenly Bodies – etc), a dia de hoy son ya 3 referencias las que tiene ya en el mercado y muy pronto verá la luz la 4ª .

Actualmente también colabora semanalmente con Ibiza Fraile Radio(emisora de Ibiza) y con BeachGrooves (emisora de Costa del Sol) emitiéndose On Line para todos los rincones del Mundo.

Marc Rocheleau is a 17 year old Dj/Producer from Cape Cod, MA. His passion for music started when he got his first drum set on his 5th birthday. When he was a freshman in high school he taught himself how to mix songs together on his ipad. Shortly after he purchased speakers with a mixer and played at small parties. After being asked to perform at a sweet 16 he connected with a local Dj, Dj Alvzie. That winter he spent hours every day perfecting his mixing skills. The next summer when he turned 15, he performed at a series of bikini contest on Cape Cod. He also had his first solo gig at The Beach House bar in Falmouth. When he was 16, he had a weekly residency at The Falmouth Raw Bar. Then he started making his own mashups, gaining support from Boston Dj, Richard Fraioli. Now at 17 years old, Marc Rocheleau is producing his own music. His first song ""Oh No"" with acoustic singer Jake Durkin was released on Tuesday June 9th, 2015. He is also working on many more projects in the progressive house, electro house, hip hop, and trap categories. Marc Rocheleau plans on continuing his career in College.

Keep your eyes open for Chronic Fusion Live dates. With this project, we perform electronic and acoustic music fused together live. It's totally a next level good time.
