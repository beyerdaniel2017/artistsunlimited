Chill/Mainstream,Ookay,"One of the most impressive young leaders of the American trap scene, California-based Ookay (pronounced “okay”) exploded onto the scene when both his freshman and sophomore releases on Ultra Records charted in the top 10 on Beatport. Since then, he’s shown no sign of slowing down, working with some of the greatest producers in electronic music while developing a signature style that weaves across genres, reflecting influences as varied as Borgore, Diplo, DJ Snake, Showtek, Deorro, TJR, Boaz Van de Beatz, Valentino Kahn, Waveracer, Cashmere Cat, Lindsay Lowend, Skrillex, Lido, and Wiwek while always returning to a hard-hitting trap beat.

The producer and DJ has racked up credits and quickly made a name for himself with remixes of tracks like Congrorock’s “Bless Di Nation Ft. Sean Paul” and Steve Aoki, Chris Lake & Tujamo’s “Boneless.” Ookay teamed up with iconic producer Diplo to remix Avicii’s “You Make Me,” and his recent remix of “Kanye” by the Chainsmokers on Republic/Dim Mak Records layers his signature mix of dance music and hip-hop over fluttering pop vocals. His side project Coaster serves as an outlet for his love of alternative dance and house music, proving Ookay to be no one-trick trap pony. 

His much-anticipated spring single ""Bouncer,"" produced with the venerable Dutch duo Showtek, hit the top 3 Beatport overall chart after its March 2014 release and was a staple on summer festival stages across the country. Ookay has also quickly become known as a charismatic performer both on and off stage, appearing at venues like EDC Las Vegas, Electric Zoo, Red Rocks, and TomorrowWorld. His live shows are known for sleek transitions, sensitive song selections, and entertaining MC’ing from the booth. He’s also no slouch on Twitter, commenting on everything from the struggle to Shazam an unknown song to LA’s Korean BBQ scene. 

It’s no surprise that Ghost, out November 10 on Dim Mak Records, is one of the most exciting dance music releases of the fall. Promised to be “a blend of listening tracks as well as club bangers,” it fulfills that goal. Ghost is one of the too-rare records that will bring you from your morning commute, with the meditative “Ghost” and “Matters,” to 4 AM on the dance floor losing it to “Egg Drop Soup.” 

The Ghost Tour this fall and winter is sure to blow up dance floors across America, and truly solidify Ookay’s status as one of America’s premier young electronic artists. With support from such icons as Showtek and Diplo as well as Tiesto, Steve Aoki, Major Lazer, Borgore, Nervo, David Guetta, DJ Snake, Deorro, TJR, Krewella and more, it seems certain that Ookay’s star will only continue to rise.

„No music – no life“.

The love of music has always been the driving force behind everything Gamper & Dadoni do.

One a student of music and the other audio engineering, the two young artists from Hamburg (Germany) started as a Producer/DJ team in spring 2013 and were soon generating over 100 million plays on YouTube and Soundcloud.

Their sound is a thrilling mixture of melodic and funky house that has rapidly gained the support of world renowned DJs such as Kygo, Klingande, Lost Frequencies, Robin Schulz, Felix Jaehn and Michael Calfan - all of whom regularly play their tracks.

Over the last 12 months Gamper & Dadoni have played over 60 shows in more than 15 countries and whether it's Paris, London, Dublin or Berlin the duo always leave their mark.

So prepare yourself for a musical journey that will captivate your senses and let you lose yourself to dance.",129448

Creative,Nicholas Miller,"There are melodic bass producers, and then there is Nick Miller. The Denver-based producer known as Illenium has been turning heads in the dance music community over the past year and for good reason. Illenium has distinguished himself from the myriad of others through an unrivaled ability to create an immersive emotional experience of highs and lows that pulls on the heart strings and leaves the listener awestruck, accomplishing in the span of just a few short minutes what takes many a full set. He has displayed an adeptness for creating aural arrangements that vary in style, yet always maintain beauty, complexity and emotional depth. Illenium gave the world a taste of what he has to offer in 2014 with standout originals “Falling In,” “So Wrong,” “Make Me Do;” remixes of Dawn Golden, Odesza, Oh Wonder; and performances at Global Dance Festival, Decadence NYE and other select dates. However, as foreshadowed by his inclusion in UKF’s “Ones to Watch: 15 for 2015,” this is poised to be Illenium’s breakout year.

Hectic has dropped a wide variety of tracks over the last few years, ranging from dubstep to garage and UK bass music. Previous releases including ''The Ripper'', ''Hard'', ''My Universe'' (featuring UK MC Janset) and ''Cyber Girl'', as well as various tracks on DJ Hatcha's label, Hatched, delivered a raw, uncut and heavy dubstep workout to the dance floors. Hectic also has an ever growing collection of remixes created for the likes of Modern Machines, The Freestylers, Adi Ulmansky, Veronika Vesper, Lindsay Mac, Them&Us, Lihot and Monkixx. He has received radio play and support from DJs on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Kiss FM, XFM, Sub FM and Reprezent Radio. This year, Hectic has set up his own label, Cover The Earth, which will aim to release forward thinking music from all realms of the spectrum. The first release on the new label will be ''Golden''. A collaboration project between Hectic and American/Australian singer and songwriter, Camille, due out in April. Setting the pace with relentless beats in a spacious and rough soundscape, it is clear that Hectic gives a new twist to multiple bass oriented genres.

Hailing from Germany, Styline is the sonic innovator that has been sending shockwaves across the electronic music spectrum with his unique brand of house music. Pioneering his own Power House genre, Styline has proven his versatility as a producer and has garnered a solid legion of followers with his innovative and dynamic productions.  

Starting out in 2009, Styline dedicated his free time to crafting high-energy filled electro and progressive house mixes, which he uploaded onto his YouTube channel. Winning listeners over with his skillful selections, he amassed over 200 million views on his channel, making a name for himself as a worldwide Internet phenomenon. Founding Arcane, the largest DJ Network on YouTube, Styline established an entirely new path for DJs and producers and the way that people access the world of electronic dance music. Taking his passion to the next level, Styline decided to take his music overseas, focusing on the burgeoning Asian electronic dance music scene, securing himself a residency at one of the most reputable nightclubs in Asia, M1NT Club Shanghai. 

Attracting music lovers to his SoundCloud with a selection of hard-hitting remixes and originals, all available for free download, Styline has spent the past 6 months developing his distinctive Power House genre. Featuring punchy basslines, groove-inducing melodies and tailored vocals, this genre has surged in popularity and has taken club music to a completely new realm. Releasing his dance floor gem ‘Rose’ in December 2015, Styline caught the attention of Spinnin’ Records, who signed the track to their SPRS imprint and released it with a fitting music video on their YouTube channel. With Styline’s massive remixes making their rounds, such as his edit of Valentino Khan’s ‘Deep Down Low’, his signature sound is infiltrating into the charts and readying the electronic music world for the future of Power House! Aside from a prolific release schedule, Styline has delivered copious amounts of energy-fuelled live shows over the past few years, further raising awareness about the remarkable artist that he is.

Garnering over 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel and over 200,000 fans on Facebook, in a short time Styline has made a colossal mark on the music world, and is just getting warmed up. With plenty more releases lined up, and an abundance of ideas ready to get put into action, Styline will not rest until he has spread his coveted sound to every corner of the globe in an emphatic manner. Gearing up to make 2016 his biggest year to date, Styline is set to perform at some of the most important dance music events this year; including Ultra Music Festival Miami, Inception At Sea alongside The Chainsmokers and Winter Music Conference shows. With a burning desire to take his prodigious sound to the next level over the course of the year, stay tuned for the next phase of Styline’s enthralling Power House takeover!",164909

Indie/Alternative,,"While it may look that way on stage, nothing is ever simple with Keys N Krates. Not when everyone has an equally valid opinion, along with the willingness (no, the all-consuming need) to sit and scrutinize a hearty 808 hit or laser like synth line for hours on end.

It's been this way since the very beginning, when Keys N Krates went from being a live hip-hop band reliant on rough acapellas and memory-jogging remixes to something much more complex - a tight-knit trio of producers/performers - Turntablist Jr Flo, Keyboard player David Matisse, drummer Adam Tune - who take rocking a party as seriously as a week spent in the studio. ""We always trade roles from song to song,"" explains Jr. Flo.  ""It's not uncommon for Matisse to flip a sample, or for me to write a melody, or for Tune to chime in on the mixing of a track. It's not the fastest way of working, but everyone has a say in everything.""

Which explains why their breakthrough singles (the elastic loops and diamond-edged drums of ""Dum Dee Dum,"" the head rush hooks of ""Treat Me Right,"" a frantic, D'n'B-flavored ""Are We Faded"") are able to pull the strings of packed festival crowds without resorting to tired EDM tropes. Hip-hop, house and UK bass music all play a role in a Keys N Krates record, but so do the dark-tinged dynamics and widescreen ways of indie acts like Caribou and M83. ""Seeing M83 live at the Osheaga festival changed our whole perception of how their music translates live,"" says Jr. Flo. ""The chord progressions are beautiful and catchy but never corny. It's pop music at its best.""

That was essentially the goal with the Toronto group's new Midnite Mass EP: cuts that are calibrated for clubs but that can translate beyond. Punchy and powerful. Emotional and epic. That goes for everything from its title track (an intro that sounds like a suspenseful thesis) to a Katy B collab (""Save Me"") that'll beam old-school ravers straight back to the '90s. And then there's something as deceivingly simple as ""Love Again,"" a soulful rap beat created from scratch and such artful details as the orchestral flourishes of Ouici and the gospel vocals of a friend named JP. Let's just say it's no coincidence that the song sounds like it sampled a dust-caked '70s record from a long-buried discount bin;  That Just Blaze or Kanye might find and flip, Keys N Krates want to leave you wondering just how they do it.     

“We wanted people to wonder where we got a lot of the sounds for this EP, the same way we have when listening to producers like Just Blaze and Timbaland.  Those guys have always used source samples or sounds that leave you scratching your head.  We love that simplicity; it's like true Italian cooking, a few ingredients to make something so impactful…. beats that leave you wondering 'where the fuck did he get that sound from?'
