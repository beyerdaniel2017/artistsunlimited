            <p>At the core, AU is a team of computer scientists who love music. What started as simple observations led to a startling conclusion of today’s world: artists are unprepared on how to use the internet for their careers. Browse SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube for a couple of hours and it becomes shocking how much talent is left unheard. We are taking this opportunity to take step away from the current paradigm where radio and mainstream music are controlled by a handful of labels. We are taking step towards a new vision, the very core AU's mission, where artists truly have a chance to be successful independently.<br><br>We are dedicated to making sure every submission that comes our way is heard. We work to ensuring organic engagement on SoundCloud, Spotify, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and other online platforms.<br><br>We are committed to following every twist and turn of how music is promoted and spread on the internet, a task that requires constant awareness of the shifting dynamics of technologies and emergences of new platforms that affect the way we consume music. With this, we have distilled these insights and used them to develop will turn these insights into user-friendly applications, tools for artists.<br><br>We are here to remove the element of chance from becoming known. Working with us, it no longer becomes a hope that you will “blow up” and become viral, or even find substantive but intermittent success. Rather, with us, it is a function of pure promotion across our already well-established networks, gaining exposure to thousands of people which will stream your music through thousands of headphones across the world, and using tried-and-true tools that are an essential part  producing the highest-quality content possible.</p>

            <p>We believe in a world where artists are able to simply focus on making music while optimize exposure to audiences everywhere. We are here to democratize the music industry.
