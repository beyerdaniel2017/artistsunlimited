                  <h4>How can we help you?</h4>
                  <p>At the core, AU is a team of computer scientists who love music. What started as simple observations led to a startling conclusion of today’s world: artists are unprepared on how to use the internet for their careers. Step into Sound Cloud, Spotify, Youtube for a couple of hours and it will shock anyone how much talent is left unheard. We would like to take step away from the current paradigm, where Radio and Mainstream Music is controlled by a handful of labels and take a step towards a new vision, where artists truly have a chance to be successful independently.<br>We are dedicated to making sure music undergoing our system is heard. We work with multiple clients on ensuring organic engagement on various SoundCloud, Spotify, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and other online platforms.<br>The goal is to strive for a deep understanding in how the internet can be used to aid artists careers. With this, we will turn these insights into easy-to-use plugins, tools, or applications. We hope that every addition or update to the AU Tools will flatten the music industry a little more, allowing the unheard to be heard.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                  <h4>What is our vision?</h4>
                  <p>We believe in a world where artists focus on making music while we focus on maximizing an artist’s efficiency and effectiveness online. We would like to democratize the music industry. We believe in a world where a bedroom producer can have the same chance of entering charts as a producer signed to a major label.</p>

                  <h4>As a music curator, what are the benefits of joining the AU Network?</h4>
                  <p>We are not only dedicated in empowering artists directly, but also indirectly. In helping music curators be more effective at releasing music themselves, artists will indirectly benefit.  By joining the AU Network, a content curator will have all of the tools and resources to successfully launch any of their musical brands. These are tools and resources we have created over hours of working closely with various online music distributors.</p>
